<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<p>From the first the voyage was going wrong.&nbsp; Routed out of
my hotel on a bitter March morning, I had crossed Baltimore and
reached the pier-end precisely on time.&nbsp; At nine
o&rsquo;clock the tug was to have taken me down the bay and put
me on board the <i>Elsinore</i>, and with growing irritation I
sat frozen inside my taxicab and waited.&nbsp; On the seat,
outside, the driver and Wada sat hunched in a temperature perhaps
half a degree colder than mine.&nbsp; And there was no tug.</p>
<p>Possum, the fox-terrier puppy Galbraith had so inconsiderately
foisted upon me, whimpered and shivered on my lap inside my
greatcoat and under the fur robe.&nbsp; But he would not settle
down.&nbsp; Continually he whimpered and clawed and struggled to
get out.&nbsp; And, once out and bitten by the cold, with equal
insistence he whimpered and clawed to get back.</p>
<p>His unceasing plaint and movement was anything but sedative to
my jangled nerves.&nbsp; In the first place I was uninterested in
the brute.&nbsp; He meant nothing to me.&nbsp; I did not know
him.&nbsp; Time and again, as I drearily waited, I was on the
verge of giving him to the driver.&nbsp; Once, when two little
girls&mdash;evidently the wharfinger&rsquo;s daughters&mdash;went
by, my hand reached out to the door to open it so that I might
call to them and present them with the puling little wretch.</p>
<p>A farewell surprise package from Galbraith, he had arrived at
the hotel the night before, by express from New York.&nbsp; It
was Galbraith&rsquo;s way.&nbsp; Yet he might so easily have been
decently like other folk and sent fruit . . . or flowers,
even.&nbsp; But no; his affectionate inspiration had to take the
form of a yelping, yapping two months&rsquo; old puppy.&nbsp; And
with the advent of the terrier the trouble had begun.&nbsp; The
hotel clerk judged me a criminal before the act I had not even
had time to meditate.&nbsp; And then Wada, on his own initiative
and out of his own foolish stupidity, had attempted to smuggle
the puppy into his room and been caught by a house
detective.&nbsp; Promptly Wada had forgotten all his English and
lapsed into hysterical Japanese, and the house detective
remembered only his Irish; while the hotel clerk had given me to
understand in no uncertain terms that it was only what he had
expected of me.</p>
<p>Damn the dog, anyway!&nbsp; And damn Galbraith too!&nbsp; And
as I froze on in the cab on that bleak pier-end, I damned myself
as well, and the mad freak that had started me voyaging on a
sailing-ship around the Horn.</p>
<p>By ten o&rsquo;clock a nondescript youth arrived on foot,
carrying a suit-case, which was turned over to me a few minutes
later by the wharfinger.&nbsp; It belonged to the pilot, he said,
and gave instructions to the chauffeur how to find some other
pier from which, at some indeterminate time, I should be taken
aboard the <i>Elsinore</i> by some other tug.&nbsp; This served
to increase my irritation.&nbsp; Why should I not have been
informed as well as the pilot?</p>
<p>An hour later, still in my cab and stationed at the shore end
of the new pier, the pilot arrived.&nbsp; Anything more unlike a
pilot I could not have imagined.&nbsp; Here was no blue-jacketed,
weather-beaten son of the sea, but a soft-spoken gentleman, for
all the world the type of successful business man one meets in
all the clubs.&nbsp; He introduced himself immediately, and I
invited him to share my freezing cab with Possum and the
baggage.&nbsp; That some change had been made in the arrangements
by Captain West was all he knew, though he fancied the tug would
come along any time.</p>
<p>And it did, at one in the afternoon, after I had been
compelled to wait and freeze for four mortal hours.&nbsp; During
this time I fully made up my mind that I was not going to like
this Captain West.&nbsp; Although I had never met him, his
treatment of me from the outset had been, to say the least,
cavalier.&nbsp; When the <i>Elsinore</i> lay in Erie Basin, just
arrived from California with a cargo of barley, I had crossed
over from New York to inspect what was to be my home for many
months.&nbsp; I had been delighted with the ship and the cabin
accommodation.&nbsp; Even the stateroom selected for me was
satisfactory and far more spacious than I had expected.&nbsp; But
when I peeped into the captain&rsquo;s room I was amazed at its
comfort.&nbsp; When I say that it opened directly into a
bath-room, and that, among other things, it was furnished with a
big brass bed such as one would never suspect to find at sea, I
have said enough.</p>
<p>Naturally, I had resolved that the bath-room and the big brass
bed should be mine.&nbsp; When I asked the agents to arrange with
the captain they seemed non-committal and uncomfortable.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know in the least what it is worth,&rdquo; I
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t care.&nbsp; Whether it costs
one hundred and fifty dollars or five hundred, I must have those
quarters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harrison and Gray, the agents, debated silently with each
other and scarcely thought Captain West would see his way to the
arrangement.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then he is the first sea captain I ever
heard of that wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I asserted
confidently.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, the captains of all the Atlantic
liners regularly sell their quarters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Captain West is not the captain of an Atlantic
liner,&rdquo; Mr. Harrison observed gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember, I am to be on that ship many a month,&rdquo;
I retorted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, heavens, bid him up to a thousand
if necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll try,&rdquo; said Mr. Gray, &ldquo;but we
warn you not to place too much dependence on our efforts.&nbsp;
Captain West is in Searsport at the present time, and we will
write him to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To my astonishment Mr. Gray called me up several days later to
inform me that Captain West had declined my offer.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Did you offer him up to a thousand?&rdquo; I
demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He regretted that he was unable to concede what you
asked,&rdquo; Mr. Gray replied.</p>
<p>A day later I received a letter from Captain West.&nbsp; The
writing and the wording were old-fashioned and formal.&nbsp; He
regretted not having yet met me, and assured me that he would see
personally that my quarters were made comfortable.&nbsp; For that
matter he had already dispatched orders to Mr. Pike, the first
mate of the <i>Elsinore</i>, to knock out the partition between
my state-room and the spare state-room adjoining.&nbsp;
Further&mdash;and here is where my dislike for Captain West
began&mdash;he informed me that if, when once well at sea, I
should find myself dissatisfied, he would gladly, in that case,
exchange quarters with me.</p>
<p>Of course, after such a rebuff, I knew that no circumstance
could ever persuade me to occupy Captain West&rsquo;s brass
bed.&nbsp; And it was this Captain Nathaniel West, whom I had not
yet met, who had now kept me freezing on pier-ends through four
miserable hours.&nbsp; The less I saw of him on the voyage the
better, was my decision; and it was with a little tickle of
pleasure that I thought of the many boxes of books I had
dispatched on board from New York.&nbsp; Thank the Lord, I did
not depend on sea captains for entertainment.</p>
<p>I turned Possum over to Wada, who was settling with the
cabman, and while the tug&rsquo;s sailors were carrying my
luggage on board I was led by the pilot to an introduction with
Captain West.&nbsp; At the first glimpse I knew that he was no
more a sea captain than the pilot was a pilot.&nbsp; I had seen
the best of the breed, the captains of the liners, and he no more
resembled them than did he resemble the bluff-faced, gruff-voiced
skippers I had read about in books.&nbsp; By his side stood a
woman, of whom little was to be seen and who made a warm and
gorgeous blob of colour in the huge muff and boa of red fox in
which she was well-nigh buried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God!&mdash;his wife!&rdquo; I darted in a whisper at
the pilot.&nbsp; &ldquo;Going along with him? . . . &rdquo;</p>
<p>I had expressly stipulated with Mr. Harrison, when engaging
passage, that the one thing I could not possibly consider was the
skipper of the <i>Elsinore</i> taking his wife on the
voyage.&nbsp; And Mr. Harrison had smiled and assured me that
Captain West would sail unaccompanied by a wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s his daughter,&rdquo; the pilot replied under
his breath.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come to see him off, I fancy.&nbsp; His
wife died over a year ago.&nbsp; They say that is what sent him
back to sea.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d retired, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain West advanced to meet me, and before our outstretched
hands touched, before his face broke from repose to greeting and
the lips moved to speech, I got the first astonishing impact of
his personality.&nbsp; Long, lean, in his face a touch of race I
as yet could only sense, he was as cool as the day was cold, as
poised as a king or emperor, as remote as the farthest fixed
star, as neutral as a proposition of Euclid.&nbsp; And then, just
ere our hands met, a twinkle of&mdash;oh&mdash;such distant and
controlled geniality quickened the many tiny wrinkles in the
corner of the eyes; the clear blue of the eyes was suffused by an
almost colourful warmth; the face, too, seemed similarly to
suffuse; the thin lips, harsh-set the instant before, were as
gracious as Bernhardt&rsquo;s when she moulds sound into
speech.</p>
<p>So curiously was I affected by this first glimpse of Captain
West that I was aware of expecting to fall from his lips I knew
not what words of untold beneficence and wisdom.&nbsp; Yet he
uttered most commonplace regrets at the delay in a voice
provocative of fresh surprise to me.&nbsp; It was low and gentle,
almost too low, yet clear as a bell and touched with a faint
reminiscent twang of old New England.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this is the young woman who is guilty of the
delay,&rdquo; he concluded my introduction to his daughter.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Margaret, this is Mr. Pathurst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her gloved hand promptly emerged from the fox-skins to meet
mine, and I found myself looking into a pair of gray eyes bent
steadily and gravely upon me.&nbsp; It was discomfiting, that
cool, penetrating, searching gaze.&nbsp; It was not that it was
challenging, but that it was so insolently business-like.&nbsp;
It was much in the very way one would look at a new coachman he
was about to engage.&nbsp; I did not know then that she was to go
on the voyage, and that her curiosity about the man who was to be
a fellow-passenger for half a year was therefore only
natural.&nbsp; Immediately she realized what she was doing, and
her lips and eyes smiled as she spoke.</p>
<p>As we moved on to enter the tug&rsquo;s cabin I heard
Possum&rsquo;s shivering whimper rising to a screech, and went
forward to tell Wada to take the creature in out of the
cold.&nbsp; I found him hovering about my luggage, wedging my
dressing-case securely upright by means of my little automatic
rifle.&nbsp; I was startled by the mountain of luggage around
which mine was no more than a fringe.&nbsp; Ship&rsquo;s stores,
was my first thought, until I noted the number of trunks, boxes,
suit-cases, and parcels and bundles of all sorts.&nbsp; The
initials on what looked suspiciously like a woman&rsquo;s hat
trunk caught my eye&mdash;&ldquo;M.W.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet Captain
West&rsquo;s first name was Nathaniel.&nbsp; On closer
investigation I did find several &ldquo;N.W&rsquo;s.&rdquo; but
everywhere I could see &ldquo;M.W&rsquo;s.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then I
remembered that he had called her Margaret.</p>
<p>I was too angry to return to the cabin, and paced up and down
the cold deck biting my lips with vexation.&nbsp; I had so
expressly stipulated with the agents that no captain&rsquo;s wife
was to come along.&nbsp; The last thing under the sun I desired
in the pet quarters of a ship was a woman.&nbsp; But I had never
thought about a captain&rsquo;s daughter.&nbsp; For two cents I
was ready to throw the voyage over and return on the tug to
Baltimore.</p>
<p>By the time the wind caused by our speed had chilled me
bitterly, I noticed Miss West coming along the narrow deck, and
could not avoid being struck by the spring and vitality of her
walk.&nbsp; Her face, despite its firm moulding, had a suggestion
of fragility that was belied by the robustness of her body.&nbsp;
At least, one would argue that her body must be robust from her
fashion of movement of it, though little could one divine the
lines of it under the shapelessness of the furs.</p>
<p>I turned away on my heel and fell moodily to contemplating the
mountain of luggage.&nbsp; A huge packing-case attracted my
attention, and I was staring at it when she spoke at my
shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what really caused the delay,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; I asked incuriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the <i>Elsinore&rsquo;s</i> piano, all
renovated.&nbsp; When I made up my mind to come, I telegraphed
Mr. Pike&mdash;he&rsquo;s the mate, you know.&nbsp; He did his
best.&nbsp; It was the fault of the piano house.&nbsp; And while
we waited to-day I gave them a piece of my mind they&rsquo;ll not
forget in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed at the recollection, and commenced to peep and
peer into the luggage as if in search of some particular
piece.&nbsp; Having satisfied herself, she was starting back,
when she paused and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come into the cabin where it&rsquo;s
warm?&nbsp; We won&rsquo;t be there for half an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did you decide to make this voyage?&rdquo; I
demanded abruptly.</p>
<p>So quick was the look she gave me that I knew she had in that
moment caught all my disgruntlement and disgust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two days ago,&rdquo; she answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her readiness for give and take took me aback, and before I
could speak she went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re not to be at all silly about my
coming, Mr. Pathurst.&nbsp; I probably know more about
long-voyaging than you do, and we&rsquo;re all going to be
comfortable and happy.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t bother me, and I
promise you I won&rsquo;t bother you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve sailed
with passengers before, and I&rsquo;ve learned to put up with
more than they ever proved they were able to put up with.&nbsp;
So there.&nbsp; Let us start right, and it won&rsquo;t be any
trouble to keep on going right.&nbsp; I know what is the matter
with you.&nbsp; You think you&rsquo;ll be called upon to
entertain me.&nbsp; Please know that I do not need
entertainment.&nbsp; I never saw the longest voyage that was too
long, and I always arrive at the end with too many things not
done for the passage ever to have been tedious, and . . . I
don&rsquo;t play <i>Chopsticks</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<p>The <i>Elsinore</i>, fresh-loaded with coal, lay very deep in
the water when we came alongside.&nbsp; I knew too little about
ships to be capable of admiring her lines, and, besides, I was in
no mood for admiration.&nbsp; I was still debating with myself
whether or not to chuck the whole thing and return on the
tug.&nbsp; From all of which it must not be taken that I am a
vacillating type of man.&nbsp; On the contrary.</p>
<p>The trouble was that at no time, from the first thought of it,
had I been keen for the voyage.&nbsp; Practically the reason I
was taking it was because there was nothing else I was keen
on.&nbsp; For some time now life had lost its savour.&nbsp; I was
not jaded, nor was I exactly bored.&nbsp; But the zest had gone
out of things.&nbsp; I had lost taste for my fellow-men and all
their foolish, little, serious endeavours.&nbsp; For a far longer
period I had been dissatisfied with women.&nbsp; I had endured
them, but I had been too analytic of the faults of their
primitiveness, of their almost ferocious devotion to the destiny
of sex, to be enchanted with them.&nbsp; And I had come to be
oppressed by what seemed to me the futility of art&mdash;a
pompous legerdemain, a consummate charlatanry that deceived not
only its devotees but its practitioners.</p>
<p>In short, I was embarking on the <i>Elsinore</i> because it
was easier to than not; yet everything else was as equally and
perilously easy.&nbsp; That was the curse of the condition into
which I had fallen.&nbsp; That was why, as I stepped upon the
deck of the <i>Elsinore</i>, I was half of a mind to tell them to
keep my luggage where it was and bid Captain West and his
daughter good-day.</p>
<p>I almost think what decided me was the welcoming, hospitable
smile Miss West gave me as she started directly across the deck
for the cabin, and the knowledge that it must be quite warm in
the cabin.</p>
<p>Mr. Pike, the mate, I had already met, when I visited the ship
in Erie Basin.&nbsp; He smiled a stiff, crack-faced smile that I
knew must be painful, but did not offer to shake hands, turning
immediately to call orders to half-a-dozen frozen-looking youths
and aged men who shambled up from somewhere in the waist of the
ship.&nbsp; Mr. Pike had been drinking.&nbsp; That was
patent.&nbsp; His face was puffed and discoloured, and his large
gray eyes were bitter and bloodshot.</p>
<p>I lingered, with a sinking heart watching my belongings come
aboard and chiding my weakness of will which prevented me from
uttering the few words that would put a stop to it.&nbsp; As for
the half-dozen men who were now carrying the luggage aft into the
cabin, they were unlike any concept I had ever entertained of
sailors.&nbsp; Certainly, on the liners, I had observed nothing
that resembled them.</p>
<p>One, a most vivid-faced youth of eighteen, smiled at me from a
pair of remarkable Italian eyes.&nbsp; But he was a dwarf.&nbsp;
So short was he that he was all sea-boots and
sou&rsquo;wester.&nbsp; And yet he was not entirely
Italian.&nbsp; So certain was I that I asked the mate, who
answered morosely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Him?&nbsp; Shorty?&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a dago
half-breed.&nbsp; The other half&rsquo;s Jap or Malay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One old man, who I learned was a bosun, was so decrepit that I
thought he had been recently injured.&nbsp; His face was stolid
and ox-like, and as he shuffled and dragged his brogans over the
deck he paused every several steps to place both hands on his
abdomen and execute a queer, pressing, lifting movement.&nbsp;
Months were to pass, in which I saw him do this thousands of
times, ere I learned that there was nothing the matter with him
and that his action was purely a habit.&nbsp; His face reminded
me of the Man with the Hoe, save that it was unthinkably and
abysmally stupider.&nbsp; And his name, as I was to learn, of all
names was Sundry Buyers.&nbsp; And he was bosun of the fine
American sailing-ship <i>Elsinore</i>&mdash;rated one of the
finest sailing-ships afloat!</p>
<p>Of this group of aged men and boys that moved the luggage
along I saw only one, called Henry, a youth of sixteen, who
approximated in the slightest what I had conceived all sailors to
be like.&nbsp; He had come off a training ship, the mate told me,
and this was his first voyage to sea.&nbsp; His face was
keen-cut, alert, as were his bodily movements, and he wore
sailor-appearing clothes with sailor-seeming grace.&nbsp; In
fact, as I was to learn, he was to be the only sailor-seeming
creature fore and aft.</p>
<p>The main crew had not yet come aboard, but was expected at any
moment, the mate vouchsafed with a snarl of ominous
expectancy.&nbsp; Those already on board were the miscellaneous
ones who had shipped themselves in New York without the mediation
of boarding-house masters.&nbsp; And what the crew itself would
be like God alone could tell&mdash;so said the mate.&nbsp;
Shorty, the Japanese (or Malay) and Italian half-caste, the mate
told me, was an able seaman, though he had come out of steam and
this was his first sailing voyage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ordinary seamen!&rdquo; Mr. Pike snorted, in reply to a
question.&nbsp; &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t carry
Landsmen!&mdash;forget it!&nbsp; Every clodhopper an&rsquo;
cow-walloper these days is an able seaman.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the
way they rank and are paid.&nbsp; The merchant service is all
shot to hell.&nbsp; There ain&rsquo;t no more sailors.&nbsp; They
all died years ago, before you were born even.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could smell the raw whiskey on the mate&rsquo;s
breath.&nbsp; Yet he did not stagger nor show any signs of
intoxication.&nbsp; Not until afterward was I to know that his
willingness to talk was most unwonted and was where the liquor
gave him away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;d a-ben a grace had I died years ago,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;rather than to a-lived to see sailors an&rsquo;
ships pass away from the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I understand the <i>Elsinore</i> is considered one
of the finest,&rdquo; I urged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So she is . . . to-day.&nbsp; But what is she?&mdash;a
damned cargo-carrier.&nbsp; She ain&rsquo;t built for
sailin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; if she was there ain&rsquo;t no sailors
left to sail her.&nbsp; Lord!&nbsp; Lord!&nbsp; The old
clippers!&nbsp; When I think of &rsquo;em!&mdash;<i>The
Gamecock</i>, <i>Shootin&rsquo; Star</i>, <i>Flyin&rsquo;
Fish</i>, <i>Witch o&rsquo; the Wave</i>, <i>Staghound</i>,
<i>Harvey Birch</i>, <i>Canvas-back</i>, <i>Fleetwing</i>, <i>Sea
Serpent</i>, <i>Northern Light</i>!&nbsp; An&rsquo; when I think
of the fleets of the tea-clippers that used to load at Hong Kong
an&rsquo; race the Eastern Passages.&nbsp; A fine sight!&nbsp; A
fine sight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was interested.&nbsp; Here was a man, a live man.&nbsp; I
was in no hurry to go into the cabin, where I knew Wada was
unpacking my things, so I paced up and down the deck with the
huge Mr. Pike.&nbsp; Huge he was in all conscience,
broad-shouldered, heavy-boned, and, despite the profound stoop of
his shoulders, fully six feet in height.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a splendid figure of a man,&rdquo; I
complimented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was, I was,&rdquo; he muttered sadly, and I caught
the whiff of whiskey strong on the air.</p>
<p>I stole a look at his gnarled hands.&nbsp; Any finger would
have made three of mine.&nbsp; His wrist would have made three of
my wrist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much do you weigh?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two hundred an&rsquo; ten.&nbsp; But in my day, at my
best, I tipped the scales close to two-forty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the <i>Elsinore</i> can&rsquo;t sail,&rdquo; I
said, returning to the subject which had roused him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you even, anything from a pound of
tobacco to a month&rsquo;s wages, she won&rsquo;t make it around
in a hundred an&rsquo; fifty days,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yet I&rsquo;ve come round in the old <i>Flyin&rsquo;
Cloud</i> in eighty-nine days&mdash;eighty-nine days, sir, from
Sandy Hook to &rsquo;Frisco.&nbsp; Sixty men for&rsquo;ard that
<i>was</i> men, an&rsquo; eight boys, an&rsquo; drive! drive!
drive!&nbsp; Three hundred an&rsquo; seventy-four miles for a
day&rsquo;s run under t&rsquo;gallantsails, an&rsquo; in the
squalls eighteen knots o&rsquo; line not enough to time
her.&nbsp; Eighty-nine days&mdash;never beat, an&rsquo; tied once
by the old <i>Andrew Jackson</i> nine years afterwards.&nbsp;
Them was the days!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did the <i>Andrew Jackson</i> tie her?&rdquo; I
asked, because of the growing suspicion that he was
&ldquo;having&rdquo; me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In 1860,&rdquo; was his prompt reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you sailed in the <i>Flying Cloud</i> nine years
before that, and this is 1913&mdash;why, that was sixty-two years
ago,&rdquo; I charged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I was seven years old,&rdquo; he chuckled.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My mother was stewardess on the <i>Flyin&rsquo;
Cloud</i>.&nbsp; I was born at sea.&nbsp; I was boy when I was
twelve, on the <i>Herald o&rsquo; the Morn</i>, when she made
around in ninety-nine days&mdash;half the crew in irons most
o&rsquo; the time, five men lost from aloft off the Horn, the
points of our sheath-knives broken square off, knuckle-dusters
an&rsquo; belayin&rsquo;-pins flyin&rsquo;, three men shot by the
officers in one day, the second mate killed dead an&rsquo; no one
to know who done it, an&rsquo; drive! drive! drive! ninety-nine
days from land to land, a run of seventeen thousand miles,
an&rsquo; east to west around Cape Stiff!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that would make you sixty-nine years old,&rdquo; I
insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which I am,&rdquo; he retorted proudly,
&ldquo;an&rsquo; a better man at that than the scrubby younglings
of these days.&nbsp; A generation of &rsquo;em would die under
the things I&rsquo;ve been through.&nbsp; Did you ever hear of
the <i>Sunny South</i>?&mdash;she that was sold in Havana to run
slaves an&rsquo; changed her name to <i>Emanuela</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve sailed the Middle Passage!&rdquo; I
cried, recollecting the old phrase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was on the <i>Emanuela</i> that day in Mozambique
Channel when the <i>Brisk</i> caught us with nine hundred slaves
between-decks.&nbsp; Only she wouldn&rsquo;t a-caught us except
for her having steam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I continued to stroll up and down beside this massive relic of
the past, and to listen to his hints and muttered reminiscences
of old man-killing and man-driving days.&nbsp; He was too real to
be true, and yet, as I studied his shoulder-stoop and the
age-drag of his huge feet, I was convinced that his years were as
he asserted.&nbsp; He spoke of a Captain Sonurs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a great captain,&rdquo; he was saying.&nbsp;
&ldquo;An&rsquo; in the two years I sailed mate with him there
was never a port I didn&rsquo;t jump the ship goin&rsquo; in
an&rsquo; stay in hiding until I sneaked aboard when she sailed
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The men, on account of the men swearin&rsquo; blood
an&rsquo; vengeance and warrants against me because of my ways of
teachin&rsquo; them to be sailors.&nbsp; Why, the times I was
caught, and the fines the skipper paid for me&mdash;and yet it
was my work that made the ship make money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He held up his huge paws, and as I stared at the battered,
malformed knuckles I understood the nature of his work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But all that&rsquo;s stopped now,&rdquo; he
lamented.&nbsp; &ldquo;A sailor&rsquo;s a gentleman these
days.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t raise your voice or your hand to
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment he was addressed from the poop-rail above by
the second mate, a medium-sized, heavily built, clean-shaven,
blond man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tug&rsquo;s in sight with the crew, sir,&rdquo; he
announced.</p>
<p>The mate grunted an acknowledgment, then added, &ldquo;Come on
down, Mr. Mellaire, and meet our passenger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could not help noting the air and carriage with which Mr.
Mellaire came down the poop-ladder and took his part in the
introduction.&nbsp; He was courteous in an old-world way,
soft-spoken, suave, and unmistakably from south of Mason and
Dixon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Southerner,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Georgia, sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; He bowed and smiled, as only
a Southerner can bow and smile.</p>
<p>His features and expression were genial and gentle, and yet
his mouth was the cruellest gash I had ever seen in a man&rsquo;s
face.&nbsp; It was a gash.&nbsp; There is no other way of
describing that harsh, thin-lipped, shapeless mouth that uttered
gracious things so graciously.&nbsp; Involuntarily I glanced at
his hands.&nbsp; Like the mate&rsquo;s, they were thick-boned,
broken-knuckled, and malformed.&nbsp; Back into his blue eyes I
looked.&nbsp; On the surface of them was a film of light, a gloss
of gentle kindness and cordiality, but behind that gloss I knew
resided neither sincerity nor mercy.&nbsp; Behind that gloss was
something cold and terrible, that lurked and waited and
watched&mdash;something catlike, something inimical and
deadly.&nbsp; Behind that gloss of soft light and of social
sparkle was the live, fearful thing that had shaped that mouth
into the gash it was.&nbsp; What I sensed behind in those eyes
chilled me with its repulsiveness and strangeness.</p>
<p>As I faced Mr. Mellaire, and talked with him, and smiled, and
exchanged amenities, I was aware of the feeling that comes to one
in the forest or jungle when he knows unseen wild eyes of hunting
animals are spying upon him.&nbsp; Frankly I was afraid of the
thing ambushed behind there in the skull of Mr. Mellaire.&nbsp;
One so as a matter of course identifies form and feature with the
spirit within.&nbsp; But I could not do this with the second
mate.&nbsp; His face and form and manner and suave ease were one
thing, inside which he, an entirely different thing, lay hid.</p>
<p>I noticed Wada standing in the cabin door, evidently waiting
to ask for instructions.&nbsp; I nodded, and prepared to follow
him inside.&nbsp; Mr. Pike looked at me quickly and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a moment, Mr. Pathurst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gave some orders to the second mate, who turned on his heel
and started for&rsquo;ard.&nbsp; I stood and waited for Mr.
Pike&rsquo;s communication, which he did not choose to make until
he saw the second mate well out of ear-shot.&nbsp; Then he leaned
closely to me and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention that little matter of my age to
anybody.&nbsp; Each year I sign on I sign my age one year
younger.&nbsp; I am fifty-four, now, on the articles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you don&rsquo;t look a day older,&rdquo; I answered
lightly, though I meant it in all sincerity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t feel it.&nbsp; I can outwork and
outgame the huskiest of the younglings.&nbsp; And don&rsquo;t let
my age get to anybody&rsquo;s ears, Mr. Pathurst.&nbsp; Skippers
are not particular for mates getting around the seventy
mark.&nbsp; And owners neither.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve had my hopes for
this ship, and I&rsquo;d a-got her, I think, except for the old
man decidin&rsquo; to go to sea again.&nbsp; As if he needed the
money!&nbsp; The old skinflint!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he well off?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well off!&nbsp; If I had a tenth of his money I could
retire on a chicken ranch in California and live like a fighting
cock&mdash;yes, if I had a fiftieth of what he&rsquo;s got salted
away.&nbsp; Why, he owns more stock in all the Blackwood ships .
. . and they&rsquo;ve always been lucky and always earned
money.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m getting old, and it&rsquo;s about time I
got a command.&nbsp; But no; the old cuss has to take it into his
head to go to sea again just as the berth&rsquo;s ripe for me to
fall into.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again I started to enter the cabin, but was stopped by the
mate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Pathurst?&nbsp; You won&rsquo;t mention about my
age?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, certainly not, Mr. Pike,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<p>Quite chilled through, I was immediately struck by the warm
comfort of the cabin.&nbsp; All the connecting doors were open,
making what I might call a large suite of rooms or a whale
house.&nbsp; The main-deck entrance, on the port side, was into a
wide, well-carpeted hallway.&nbsp; Into this hallway, from the
port side, opened five rooms: first, on entering, the
mate&rsquo;s; next, the two state-rooms which had been knocked
into one for me; then the steward&rsquo;s room; and, adjoining
his, completing the row, a state-room which was used for the
slop-chest.</p>
<p>Across the hall was a region with which I was not yet
acquainted, though I knew it contained the dining-room, the
bath-rooms, the cabin proper, which was in truth a spacious
living-room, the captain&rsquo;s quarters, and, undoubtedly, Miss
West&rsquo;s quarters.&nbsp; I could hear her humming some air as
she bustled about with her unpacking.&nbsp; The steward&rsquo;s
pantry, separated by crosshalls and by the stairway leading into
the chart-room above on the poop, was placed strategically in the
centre of all its operations.&nbsp; Thus, on the starboard side
of it were the state-rooms of the captain and Miss West,
for&rsquo;ard of it were the dining-room and main cabin; while on
the port side of it was the row of rooms I have described, two of
which were mine.</p>
<p>I ventured down the hall toward the stern, and found it opened
into the stern of the <i>Elsinore</i>, forming a single large
apartment at least thirty-five feet from side to side and fifteen
to eighteen feet in depth, curved, of course, to the lines of the
ship&rsquo;s stern.&nbsp; This seemed a store-room.&nbsp; I noted
wash-tubs, bolts of canvas, many lockers, hams and bacon hanging,
a step-ladder that led up through a small hatch to the poop, and,
in the floor, another hatch.</p>
<p>I spoke to the steward, an old Chinese, smooth-faced and brisk
of movement, whose name I never learned, but whose age on the
articles was fifty-six.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is down there?&rdquo; I asked, pointing to the
hatch in the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Him lazarette,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who eats there?&rdquo; I indicated a table with two
stationary sea-chairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Him second table.&nbsp; Second mate and carpenter him
eat that table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When I had finished giving instructions to Wada for the
arranging of my things I looked at my watch.&nbsp; It was early
yet, only several minutes after three so I went on deck again to
witness the arrival of the crew.</p>
<p>The actual coming on board from the tug I had missed, but
for&rsquo;ard of the amidship house I encountered a few laggards
who had not yet gone into the forecastle.&nbsp; These were the
worse for liquor, and a more wretched, miserable, disgusting
group of men I had never seen in any slum.&nbsp; Their clothes
were rags.&nbsp; Their faces were bloated, bloody, and
dirty.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t say they were villainous.&nbsp; They
were merely filthy and vile.&nbsp; They were vile of appearance,
of speech, and action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come!&nbsp; Come!&nbsp; Get your dunnage into the
fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;s&rsquo;le!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Pike uttered these words sharply from the bridge
above.&nbsp; A light and graceful bridge of steel rods and
planking ran the full length of the <i>Elsinore</i>, starting
from the poop, crossing the amidship house and the forecastle,
and connecting with the forecastle-head at the very bow of the
ship.</p>
<p>At the mate&rsquo;s command the men reeled about and glowered
up at him, one or two starting clumsily to obey.&nbsp; The others
ceased their drunken yammerings and regarded the mate
sullenly.&nbsp; One of them, with a face mashed by some mad god
in the making, and who was afterwards to be known by me as Larry,
burst into a guffaw, and spat insolently on the deck.&nbsp; Then,
with utmost deliberation, he turned to his fellows and demanded
loudly and huskily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who in hell&rsquo;s the old stiff, anyways?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I saw Mr. Pike&rsquo;s huge form tense convulsively and
involuntarily, and I noted the way his huge hands strained in
their clutch on the bridge-railing.&nbsp; Beyond that he
controlled himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, you,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
have nothing out of you.&nbsp; Get into the
fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;s&rsquo;le.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then, to my surprise, he turned and walked aft along the
bridge to where the tug was casting off its lines.&nbsp; So this
was all his high and mighty talk of kill and drive, I
thought.&nbsp; Not until afterwards did I recollect, as I turned
aft down the deck, that I saw Captain West leaning on the rail at
the break of the poop and gazing for&rsquo;ard.</p>
<p>The tug&rsquo;s lines were being cast off, and I was
interested in watching the manoeuvre until she had backed clear
of the ship, at which moment, from for&rsquo;ard, arose a queer
babel of howling and yelping, as numbers of drunken voices cried
out that a man was overboard.&nbsp; The second mate sprang down
the poop-ladder and darted past me along the deck.&nbsp; The
mate, still on the slender, white-painted bridge, that seemed no
more than a spider thread, surprised me by the activity with
which he dashed along the bridge to the &rsquo;midship house,
leaped upon the canvas-covered long-boat, and swung outboard
where he might see.&nbsp; Before the men could clamber upon the
rail the second mate was among them, and it was he who flung a
coil of line overboard.</p>
<p>What impressed me particularly was the mental and muscular
superiority of these two officers.&nbsp; Despite their
age&mdash;the mate sixty-nine and the second mate at least
fifty&mdash;their minds and their bodies had acted with the
swiftness and accuracy of steel springs.&nbsp; They were
potent.&nbsp; They were iron.&nbsp; They were perceivers,
willers, and doers.&nbsp; They were as of another species
compared with the sailors under them.&nbsp; While the latter,
witnesses of the happening and directly on the spot, had been
crying out in befuddled helplessness, and with slow wits and
slower bodies been climbing upon the rail, the second mate had
descended the steep ladder from the poop, covered two hundred
feet of deck, sprung upon the rail, grasped the instant need of
the situation, and cast the coil of line into the water.</p>
<p>And of the same nature and quality had been the actions of Mr.
Pike.&nbsp; He and Mr. Mellaire were masters over the wretched
creatures of sailors by virtue of this remarkable difference of
efficiency and will.&nbsp; Truly, they were more widely
differentiated from the men under them than were the men under
them differentiated from Hottentots&mdash;ay, and from
monkeys.</p>
<p>I, too, by this time, was standing on the big hawser-bitts in
a position to see a man in the water who seemed deliberately
swimming away from the ship.&nbsp; He was a dark-skinned
Mediterranean of some sort, and his face, in a clear glimpse I
caught of it, was distorted by frenzy.&nbsp; His black eyes were
maniacal.&nbsp; The line was so accurately flung by the second
mate that it fell across the man&rsquo;s shoulders, and for
several strokes his arms tangled in it ere he could swim
clear.&nbsp; This accomplished, he proceeded to scream some wild
harangue and once, as he uptossed his arms for emphasis, I saw in
his hand the blade of a long knife.</p>
<p>Bells were jangling on the tug as it started to the
rescue.&nbsp; I stole a look up at Captain West.&nbsp; He had
walked to the port side of the poop, where, hands in pockets, he
was glancing, now for&rsquo;ard at the struggling man, now aft at
the tug.&nbsp; He gave no orders, betrayed no excitement, and
appeared, I may well say, the most casual of spectators.</p>
<p>The creature in the water seemed now engaged in taking off his
clothes.&nbsp; I saw one bare arm, and then the other,
appear.&nbsp; In his struggles he sometimes sank beneath the
surface, but always he emerged, flourishing the knife and
screaming his addled harangue.&nbsp; He even tried to escape the
tug by diving and swimming underneath.</p>
<p>I strolled for&rsquo;ard, and arrived in time to see him
hoisted in over the rail of the <i>Elsinore</i>.&nbsp; He was
stark naked, covered with blood, and raving.&nbsp; He had cut and
slashed himself in a score of places.&nbsp; From one wound in the
wrist the blood spurted with each beat of the pulse.&nbsp; He was
a loathsome, non-human thing.&nbsp; I have seen a scared orang in
a zoo, and for all the world this bestial-faced, mowing,
gibbering thing reminded me of the orang.&nbsp; The sailors
surrounded him, laying hands on him, withstraining him, the while
they guffawed and cheered.&nbsp; Right and left the two mates
shoved them away, and dragged the lunatic down the deck and into
a room in the &rsquo;midship house.&nbsp; I could not help
marking the strength of Mr. Pike and Mr. Mellaire.&nbsp; I had
heard of the superhuman strength of madmen, but this particular
madman was as a wisp of straw in their hands.&nbsp; Once into the
bunk, Mr. Pike held down the struggling fool easily with one hand
while he dispatched the second mate for marlin with which to tie
the fellow&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bughouse,&rdquo; Mr. Pike grinned at me.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen some bughouse crews in my time, but this
one&rsquo;s the limit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; I asked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The man will bleed to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And good riddance,&rdquo; he answered promptly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have our hands full of him until we can lose
him somehow.&nbsp; When he gets easy I&rsquo;ll sew him up,
that&rsquo;s all, if I have to ease him with a clout of the
jaw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I glanced at the mate&rsquo;s huge paw and appreciated its
an&aelig;sthetic qualities.&nbsp; Out on deck again, I saw
Captain West on the poop, hands still in pockets, quite
uninterested, gazing at a blue break in the sky to the
north-east.&nbsp; More than the mates and the maniac, more than
the drunken callousness of the men, did this quiet figure, hands
in pockets, impress upon me that I was in a different world from
any I had known.</p>
<p>Wada broke in upon my thoughts by telling me he had been sent
to say that Miss West was serving tea in the cabin.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<p>The contrast, as I entered the cabin, was startling.&nbsp; All
contrasts aboard the <i>Elsinore</i> promised to be
startling.&nbsp; Instead of the cold, hard deck my feet sank into
soft carpet.&nbsp; In place of the mean and narrow room, built of
naked iron, where I had left the lunatic, I was in a spacious and
beautiful apartment.&nbsp; With the bawling of the men&rsquo;s
voices still in my ears, and with the pictures of their
drink-puffed and filthy faces still vivid under my eyelids, I
found myself greeted by a delicate-faced, prettily-gowned woman
who sat beside a lacquered oriental table on which rested an
exquisite tea-service of Canton china.&nbsp; All was repose and
calm.&nbsp; The steward, noiseless-footed, expressionless, was a
shadow, scarcely noticed, that drifted into the room on some
service and drifted out again.</p>
<p>Not at once could I relax, and Miss West, serving my tea,
laughed and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look as if you had been seeing things.&nbsp; The
steward tells me a man has been overboard.&nbsp; I fancy the cold
water must have sobered him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I resented her unconcern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man is a lunatic,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;This
ship is no place for him.&nbsp; He should be sent ashore to some
hospital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid, if we begin that, we&rsquo;d have to send
two-thirds of our complement ashore&mdash;one lump?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, please,&rdquo; I answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;But the
man has terribly wounded himself.&nbsp; He is liable to bleed to
death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at me for a moment, her gray eyes serious and
scrutinizing, as she passed me my cup; then laughter welled up in
her eyes, and she shook her head reprovingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now please don&rsquo;t begin the voyage by being
shocked, Mr. Pathurst.&nbsp; Such things are very ordinary
occurrences.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll get used to them.&nbsp; You must
remember some queer creatures go down to the sea in ships.&nbsp;
The man is safe.&nbsp; Trust Mr. Pike to attend to his
wounds.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve never sailed with Mr. Pike, but
I&rsquo;ve heard enough about him.&nbsp; Mr. Pike is quite a
surgeon.&nbsp; Last voyage, they say, he performed a successful
amputation, and so elated was he that he turned his attention on
the carpenter, who happened to be suffering from some sort of
indigestion.&nbsp; Mr. Pike was so convinced of the correctness
of his diagnosis that he tried to bribe the carpenter into having
his appendix removed.&rdquo;&nbsp; She broke off to laugh
heartily, then added: &ldquo;They say he offered the poor man
just pounds and pounds of tobacco to consent to the
operation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But is it safe . . . for the . . . the working of the
ship,&rdquo; I urged, &ldquo;to take such a lunatic
along?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shrugged her shoulders, as if not intending to reply, then
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This incident is nothing.&nbsp; There are always
several lunatics or idiots in every ship&rsquo;s company.&nbsp;
And they always come aboard filled with whiskey and raving.&nbsp;
I remember, once, when we sailed from Seattle, a long time ago,
one such madman.&nbsp; He showed no signs of madness at all; just
calmly seized two boarding-house runners and sprang overboard
with them.&nbsp; We sailed the same day, before the bodies were
recovered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again she shrugged her shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you?&nbsp; The sea is hard, Mr.
Pathurst.&nbsp; And for our sailors we get the worst type of
men.&nbsp; I sometimes wonder where they find them.&nbsp; And we
do our best with them, and somehow manage to make them help us
carry on our work in the world.&nbsp; But they are low . . .
low.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I listened, and studied her face, contrasting her
woman&rsquo;s sensitivity and her soft pretty dress with the
brute faces and rags of the men I had noticed, I could not help
being convinced intellectually of the rightness of her
position.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I was hurt
sentimentally,&mdash;chiefly, I do believe, because of the very
hardness and unconcern with which she enunciated her view.&nbsp;
It was because she was a woman, and so different from the
sea-creatures, that I resented her having received such harsh
education in the school of the sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could not help remarking your
father&rsquo;s&mdash;er, er <i>sang froid</i> during the
occurrence.&rdquo;&nbsp; I ventured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He never took his hands from his pockets!&rdquo; she
cried.</p>
<p>Her eyes sparkled as I nodded confirmation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew it!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s his way.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
seen it so often.&nbsp; I remember when I was twelve years
old&mdash;mother was alone&mdash;we were running into San
Francisco.&nbsp; It was in the <i>Dixie</i>, a ship almost as big
as this.&nbsp; There was a strong fair wind blowing, and father
did not take a tug.&nbsp; We sailed right through the Golden Gate
and up the San Francisco water-front.&nbsp; There was a swift
flood tide, too; and the men, both watches, were taking in sail
as fast as they could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now the fault was the steamboat captain&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
He miscalculated our speed and tried to cross our bow.&nbsp; Then
came the collision, and the <i>Dixie&rsquo;s</i> bow cut through
that steamboat, cabin and hull.&nbsp; There were hundreds of
passengers, men, women, and children.&nbsp; Father never took his
hands from his pockets.&nbsp; He sent the mate for&rsquo;ard to
superintend rescuing the passengers, who were already climbing on
to our bowsprit and forecastle-head, and in a voice no different
from what he&rsquo;d use to ask some one to pass the butter he
told the second mate to set all sail.&nbsp; And he told him which
sails to begin with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why set more sails?&rdquo; I interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because he could see the situation.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
you see, the steamboat was cut wide open.&nbsp; All that kept her
from sinking instantly was the bow of the <i>Dixie</i> jammed
into her side.&nbsp; By setting more sail and keeping before the
wind, he continued to keep the bow of the <i>Dixie</i>
jammed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was terribly frightened.&nbsp; People who had sprung
or fallen overboard were drowning on each side of us, right in my
sight, as we sailed along up the water-front.&nbsp; But when I
looked at father, there he was, just as I had always known him,
hands in pockets, walking slowly up and down, now giving an order
to the wheel&mdash;you see, he had to direct the
<i>Dixie&rsquo;s</i> course through all the shipping&mdash;now
watching the passengers swarming over our bow and along our deck,
now looking ahead to see his way through the ships at
anchor.&nbsp; Sometimes he did glance at the poor, drowning ones,
but he was not concerned with them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, there were numbers drowned, but by keeping
his hands in his pockets and his head cool he saved hundreds of
lives.&nbsp; Not until the last person was off the
steamboat&mdash;he sent men aboard to make sure&mdash;did he take
off the press of sail.&nbsp; And the steamboat sank at
once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She ceased, and looked at me with shining eyes for
approbation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was splendid,&rdquo; I acknowledged.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
admire the quiet man of power, though I confess that such
quietness under stress seems to me almost unearthly and beyond
human.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t conceive of myself acting that way,
and I am confident that I was suffering more while that poor
devil was in the water than all the rest of the onlookers put
together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father suffers!&rdquo; she defended loyally.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Only he does not show it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I bowed, for I felt she had missed my point.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<p>I came out from tea in the cabin to find the tug
<i>Britannia</i> in sight.&nbsp; She was the craft that was to
tow us down Chesapeake Bay to sea.&nbsp; Strolling for&rsquo;ard
I noted the sailors being routed out of the forecastle by Sundry
Buyers, for ever tenderly pressing his abdomen with his
hands.&nbsp; Another man was helping Sundry Buyers at routing out
the sailors.&nbsp; I asked Mr. Pike who the man was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nancy&mdash;my bosun; ain&rsquo;t he a peach?&rdquo;
was the answer I got, and from the mate&rsquo;s manner of
enunciation I was quite aware that &ldquo;Nancy&rdquo; had been
used derisively.</p>
<p>Nancy could not have been more than thirty, though he looked
as if he had lived a very long time.&nbsp; He was toothless and
sad and weary of movement.&nbsp; His eyes were slate-coloured and
muddy, his shaven face was sickly yellow.&nbsp;
Narrow-shouldered, sunken-chested, with cheeks cavernously
hollow, he looked like a man in the last stages of
consumption.&nbsp; Little life as Sundry Buyers showed, Nancy
showed even less life.&nbsp; And these were bosuns!&mdash;bosuns
of the fine American sailing-ship <i>Elsinore</i>!&nbsp; Never
had any illusion of mine taken a more distressing cropper.</p>
<p>It was plain to me that the pair of them, spineless and
spunkless, were afraid of the men they were supposed to
boss.&nbsp; And the men!&nbsp; Dor&eacute; could never have
conjured a more delectable hell&rsquo;s broth.&nbsp; For the
first time I saw them all, and I could not blame the two bosuns
for being afraid of them.&nbsp; They did not walk.&nbsp; They
slouched and shambled, some even tottered, as from weakness or
drink.</p>
<p>But it was their faces.&nbsp; I could not help remembering
what Miss West had just told me&mdash;that ships always sailed
with several lunatics or idiots in their crews.&nbsp; But these
looked as if they were all lunatic or feeble-minded.&nbsp; And I,
too, wondered where such a mass of human wreckage could have been
obtained.&nbsp; There was something wrong with all of them.&nbsp;
Their bodies were twisted, their faces distorted, and almost
without exception they were under-sized.&nbsp; The several quite
fairly large men I marked were vacant-faced.&nbsp; One man,
however, large and unmistakably Irish, was also unmistakably
mad.&nbsp; He was talking and muttering to himself as he came
out.&nbsp; A little, curved, lop-sided man, with his head on one
side and with the shrewdest and wickedest of faces and pale blue
eyes, addressed an obscene remark to the mad Irishman, calling
him O&rsquo;Sullivan.&nbsp; But O&rsquo;Sullivan took no notice
and muttered on.&nbsp; On the heels of the little lop-sided man
appeared an overgrown dolt of a fat youth, followed by another
youth so tall and emaciated of body that it seemed a marvel his
flesh could hold his frame together.</p>
<p>Next, after this perambulating skeleton, came the weirdest
creature I have ever beheld.&nbsp; He was a twisted oaf of a
man.&nbsp; Face and body were twisted as with the pain of a
thousand years of torture.&nbsp; His was the face of an
ill-treated and feeble-minded faun.&nbsp; His large black eyes
were bright, eager, and filled with pain; and they flashed
questioningly from face to face and to everything about.&nbsp;
They were so pitifully alert, those eyes, as if for ever astrain
to catch the clue to some perplexing and threatening
enigma.&nbsp; Not until afterwards did I learn the cause of
this.&nbsp; He was stone deaf, having had his ear-drums destroyed
in the boiler explosion which had wrecked the rest of him.</p>
<p>I noticed the steward, standing at the galley door and
watching the men from a distance.&nbsp; His keen, Asiatic face,
quick with intelligence, was a relief to the eye, as was the
vivid face of Shorty, who came out of the forecastle with a leap
and a gurgle of laughter.&nbsp; But there was something wrong
with him, too.&nbsp; He was a dwarf, and, as I was to come to
know, his high spirits and low mentality united to make him a
clown.</p>
<p>Mr. Pike stopped beside me a moment and while he watched the
men I watched him.&nbsp; The expression on his face was that of a
cattle-buyer, and it was plain that he was disgusted with the
quality of cattle delivered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something the matter with the last mother&rsquo;s son
of them,&rdquo; he growled.</p>
<p>And still they came: one, pallid, furtive-eyed, that I
instantly adjudged a drug fiend; another, a tiny, wizened old
man, pinch-faced and wrinkled, with beady, malevolent blue eyes;
a third, a small, well-fleshed man, who seemed to my eye the most
normal and least unintelligent specimen that had yet
appeared.&nbsp; But Mr. Pike&rsquo;s eye was better trained than
mine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with <i>you</i>?&rdquo; he
snarled at the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, sir,&rdquo; the fellow answered, stopping
immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Pike never spoke to a sailor save with a snarl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charles Davis, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you limping about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t limpin&rsquo;, sir,&rdquo; the man
answered respectfully, and, at a nod of dismissal from the mate,
marched off jauntily along the deck with a heodlum swing to the
shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a sailor all right,&rdquo; the mate
grumbled; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll bet you a pound of tobacco or a
month&rsquo;s wages there&rsquo;s something wrong with
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The forecastle now seemed empty, but the mate turned on the
bosuns with his customary snarl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in hell are you doing?&nbsp; Sleeping?&nbsp; Think
this is a rest cure?&nbsp; Get in there an&rsquo; rustle
&rsquo;em out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sundry Buyers pressed his abdomen gingerly and hesitated,
while Nancy, his face one dogged, long-suffering bleakness,
reluctantly entered the forecastle.&nbsp; Then, from inside, we
heard oaths, vile and filthy, urgings and expostulations on the
part of Nancy, meekly and pleadingly uttered.</p>
<p>I noted the grim and savage look that came on Mr. Pike&rsquo;s
face, and was prepared for I knew not what awful monstrosities to
emerge from the forecastle.&nbsp; Instead, to my surprise, came
three fellows who were strikingly superior to the ruck that had
preceded them.&nbsp; I looked to see the mate&rsquo;s face soften
to some sort of approval.&nbsp; On the contrary, his blue eyes
contracted to narrow slits, the snarl of his voice was
communicated to his lips, so that he seemed like a dog about to
bite.</p>
<p>But the three fellows.&nbsp; They were small men, all; and
young men, anywhere between twenty-five and thirty.&nbsp; Though
roughly dressed, they were well dressed, and under their clothes
their bodily movements showed physical well-being.&nbsp; Their
faces were keen cut, intelligent.&nbsp; And though I felt there
was something queer about them, I could not divine what it
was.</p>
<p>Here were no ill-fed, whiskey-poisoned men, such as the rest
of the sailors, who, having drunk up their last pay-days, had
starved ashore until they had received and drunk up their advance
money for the present voyage.&nbsp; These three, on the other
hand were supple and vigorous.&nbsp; Their movements were
spontaneously quick and accurate.&nbsp; Perhaps it was the way
they looked at me, with incurious yet calculating eyes that
nothing escaped.&nbsp; They seemed so worldly wise, so
indifferent, so sure of themselves.&nbsp; I was confident they
were not sailors.&nbsp; Yet, as shore-dwellers, I could not place
them.&nbsp; They were a type I had never encountered.&nbsp;
Possibly I can give a better idea of them by describing what
occurred.</p>
<p>As they passed before us they favoured Mr. Pike with the same
indifferent, keen glances they gave me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name&mdash;you?&rdquo; Mr. Pike
barked at the first of the trio, evidently a hybrid
Irish-Jew.&nbsp; Jewish his nose unmistakably was.&nbsp; Equally
unmistakable was the Irish of his eyes, and jaw, and upper
lip.</p>
<p>The three had immediately stopped, and, though they did not
look directly at one another, they seemed to be holding a silent
conference.&nbsp; Another of the trio, in whose veins ran God
alone knows what Semitic, Babylonish and Latin strains, gave a
warning signal.&nbsp; Oh, nothing so crass as a wink or a
nod.&nbsp; I almost doubted that I had intercepted it, and yet I
knew he had communicated a warning to his fellows.&nbsp; More a
shade of expression that had crossed his eyes, or a glint in them
of sudden light&mdash;or whatever it was, it carried the
message.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Murphy,&rdquo; the other answered the mate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; Mr. Pike snarled at him.</p>
<p>Murphy shrugged his shoulders in token that he did not
understand.&nbsp; It was the poise of the man, of the three of
them, the cool poise that impressed me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you address any officer on this ship you&rsquo;ll
say &lsquo;sir,&rsquo;&rdquo; Mr. Pike explained, his voice as
harsh as his face was forbidding.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did you get
<i>that</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes . . . sir,&rdquo; Murphy drawled with deliberate
slowness.&nbsp; &ldquo;I gotcha.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; Mr. Pike roared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; Murphy answered, so softly and carelessly
that it irritated the mate to further bullyragging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Murphy&rsquo;s too long,&rdquo; he
announced.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nosey&rsquo;ll do you aboard this
craft.&nbsp; Got <i>that</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I gotcha . . . sir,&rdquo; came the reply, insolent in
its very softness and unconcern.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nosey Murphy goes .
. . sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then he laughed&mdash;the three of them laughed, if
laughter it might be called that was laughter without sound or
facial movement.&nbsp; The eyes alone laughed, mirthlessly and
cold-bloodedly.</p>
<p>Certainly Mr. Pike was not enjoying himself with these
baffling personalities.&nbsp; He turned upon the leader, the one
who had given the warning and who looked the admixture of all
that was Mediterranean and Semitic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s <i>your</i> name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bert Rhine . . . sir,&rdquo; was the reply, in tones as
soft and careless and silkily irritating as the
other&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And <i>you</i>?&rdquo;&mdash;this to the remaining one,
the youngest of the trio, a dark-eyed, olive-skinned fellow with
a face most striking in its cameo-like beauty.&nbsp;
American-born, I placed him, of immigrants from Southern
Italy&mdash;from Naples, or even Sicily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twist . . . sir,&rdquo; he answered, precisely in the
same manner as the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too long,&rdquo; the mate sneered.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
Kid&rsquo;ll do you.&nbsp; Got <i>that</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I gotcha . . . sir.&nbsp; Kid Twist&rsquo;ll do me . .
. sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kid&rsquo;ll do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kid . . . sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the three laughed their silent, mirthless laugh.&nbsp; By
this time Mr. Pike was beside himself with a rage that could find
no excuse for action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m going to tell you something, the bunch of
you, for the good of your health.&rdquo;&nbsp; The mate&rsquo;s
voice grated with the rage he was suppressing.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
know your kind.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re dirt.&nbsp; D&rsquo;ye get
<i>that</i>?&nbsp; You&rsquo;re dirt.&nbsp; And on this ship
you&rsquo;ll be treated as dirt.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll do your work
like men, or I&rsquo;ll know the reason why.&nbsp; The first time
one of you bats an eye, or even looks like batting an eye, he
gets his.&nbsp; D&rsquo;ye get that?&nbsp; Now get out.&nbsp; Get
along for&rsquo;ard to the windlass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Pike turned on his heel, and I swung alongside of him as
he moved aft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you make of them?&rdquo; I queried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The limit,&rdquo; he grunted.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know their
kidney.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve done time, the three of them.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;re just plain sweepings of hell&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here his speech was broken off by the spectacle that greeted
him on Number Two hatch.&nbsp; Sprawled out on the hatch were
five or six men, among them Larry, the tatterdemalion who had
called him &ldquo;old stiff&rdquo; earlier in the
afternoon.&nbsp; That Larry had not obeyed orders was patent, for
he was sitting with his back propped against his sea-bag, which
ought to have been in the forecastle.&nbsp; Also, he and the
group with him ought to have been for&rsquo;ard manning the
windlass.</p>
<p>The mate stepped upon the hatch and towered over the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get up,&rdquo; he ordered.</p>
<p>Larry made an effort, groaned, and failed to get up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, sir.&nbsp; I was drunk last night
an&rsquo; slept in Jefferson Market.&nbsp; An&rsquo; this
mornin&rsquo; I was froze tight, sir.&nbsp; They had to pry me
loose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stiff with the cold you were, eh?&rdquo; the mate
grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s well ye might say it, sir,&rdquo; Larry
answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you feel like an old stiff, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry blinked with the troubled, querulous eyes of a
monkey.&nbsp; He was beginning to apprehend he knew not what, and
he knew that bending over him was a man-master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll just be showin&rsquo; you what an old
stiff feels like, anyways.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Pike mimicked the
other&rsquo;s brogue.</p>
<p>And now I shall tell what I saw happen.&nbsp; Please remember
what I have said of the huge paws of Mr. Pike, the fingers much
longer than mine and twice as thick, the wrists massive-boned,
the arm-bones and the shoulder-bones of the same massive
order.&nbsp; With one flip of his right hand, with what I might
call an open-handed, lifting, upward slap, save that it was the
ends of the fingers only that touched Larry&rsquo;s face, he
lifted Larry into the air, sprawling him backward on his back
across his sea-bag.</p>
<p>The man alongside of Larry emitted a menacing growl and
started to spring belligerently to his feet.&nbsp; But he never
reached his feet.&nbsp; Mr. Pike, with the back of same right
hand, open, smote the man on the side of the face.&nbsp; The loud
smack of the impact was startling.&nbsp; The mate&rsquo;s
strength was amazing.&nbsp; The blow looked so easy, so
effortless; it had seemed like the lazy stroke of a good-natured
bear, but in it was such a weight of bone and muscle that the man
went down sidewise and rolled off the hatch on to the deck.</p>
<p>At this moment, lurching aimlessly along, appeared
O&rsquo;Sullivan.&nbsp; A sudden access of muttering, on his
part, reached Mr. Pike&rsquo;s ear, and Mr. Pike, instantly keen
as a wild animal, his paw in the act of striking
O&rsquo;Sullivan, whipped out like a revolver shot,
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;&nbsp; Then he noted the
sense-struck face of O&rsquo;Sullivan and withheld the
blow.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bug-house,&rdquo; Mr. Pike commented.</p>
<p>Involuntarily I had glanced to see if Captain West was on the
poop, and found that we were hidden from the poop by the
&rsquo;midship house.</p>
<p>Mr. Pike, taking no notice of the man who lay groaning on the
deck, stood over Larry, who was likewise groaning.&nbsp; The rest
of the sprawling men were on their feet, subdued and
respectful.&nbsp; I, too, was respectful of this terrific, aged
figure of a man.&nbsp; The exhibition had quite convinced me of
the verity of his earlier driving and killing days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the old stiff now?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis me, sir,&rdquo; Larry moaned contritely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry got up without any difficulty at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now get for&rsquo;ard to the windlass!&nbsp; The rest
of you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they went, sullenly, shamblingly, like the cowed brutes
they were.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<p>I climbed the ladder on the side of the for&rsquo;ard house
(which house contained, as I discovered, the forecastle, the
galley, and the donkey-engine room), and went part way along the
bridge to a position by the foremast, where I could observe the
crew heaving up anchor.&nbsp; The <i>Britannia</i> was alongside,
and we were getting under way.</p>
<p>A considerable body of men was walking around with the
windlass or variously engaged on the forecastle-head.&nbsp; Of
the crew proper were two watches of fifteen men each.&nbsp; In
addition were sailmakers, boys, bosuns, and the carpenter.&nbsp;
Nearly forty men were they, but such men!&nbsp; They were sad and
lifeless.&nbsp; There was no vim, no go, no activity.&nbsp; Every
step and movement was an effort, as if they were dead men raised
out of coffins or sick men dragged from hospital beds.&nbsp; Sick
they were&mdash;whiskey-poisoned.&nbsp; Starved they were, and
weak from poor nutrition.&nbsp; And worst of all, they were
imbecile and lunatic.</p>
<p>I looked aloft at the intricate ropes, at the steel masts
rising and carrying huge yards of steel, rising higher and
higher, until steel masts and yards gave way to slender spars of
wood, while ropes and stays turned into a delicate tracery of
spider-thread against the sky.&nbsp; That such a wretched muck of
men should be able to work this magnificent ship through all
storm and darkness and peril of the sea was beyond all
seeming.&nbsp; I remembered the two mates, the super-efficiency,
mental and physical, of Mr. Mellaire and Mr. Pike&mdash;could
they make this human wreckage do it?&nbsp; They, at least,
evinced no doubts of their ability.&nbsp; The sea?&nbsp; If this
feat of mastery were possible, then clear it was that I knew
nothing of the sea.</p>
<p>I looked back at the misshapen, starved, sick, stumbling hulks
of men who trod the dreary round of the windlass.&nbsp; Mr. Pike
was right.&nbsp; These were not the brisk, devilish, able-bodied
men who manned the ships of the old clipper-ship days; who fought
their officers, who had the points of their sheath-knives broken
off, who killed and were killed, but who did their work as
men.&nbsp; These men, these shambling carcasses at the
windlass&mdash;I looked, and looked, and vainly I strove to
conjure the vision of them swinging aloft in rack and storm,
&ldquo;clearing the raffle,&rdquo; as Kipling puts it,
&ldquo;with their clasp knives in their teeth.&rdquo;&nbsp; Why
didn&rsquo;t they sing a chanty as they hove the anchor up?&nbsp;
In the old days, as I had read, the anchor always came up to the
rollicking sailor songs of sea-chested men.</p>
<p>I tired of watching the spiritless performance, and went aft
on an exploring trip along the slender bridge.&nbsp; It was a
beautiful structure, strong yet light, traversing the length of
the ship in three aerial leaps.&nbsp; It spanned from the
forecastle-head to the forecastle-house, next to the
&rsquo;midship house, and then to the poop.&nbsp; The poop, which
was really the roof or deck over all the cabin space below, and
which occupied the whole after-part of the ship, was very
large.&nbsp; It was broken only by the half-round and
half-covered wheel-house at the very stern and by the
chart-house.&nbsp; On either side of the latter two doors opened
into a tiny hallway.&nbsp; This, in turn, gave access to the
chart-room and to a stairway that led down into the cabin
quarters beneath.</p>
<p>I peeped into the chart-room and was greeted with a smile by
Captain West.&nbsp; He was lolling back comfortably in a swing
chair, his feet cocked on the desk opposite.&nbsp; On a broad,
upholstered couch sat the pilot.&nbsp; Both were smoking cigars;
and, lingering for a moment to listen to the conversation, I
grasped that the pilot was an ex-sea-captain.</p>
<p>As I descended the stairs, from Miss West&rsquo;s room came a
sound of humming and bustling, as she settled her
belongings.&nbsp; The energy she displayed, to judge by the
cheerful noises of it, was almost perturbing.</p>
<p>Passing by the pantry, I put my head inside the door to greet
the steward and courteously let him know that I was aware of his
existence.&nbsp; Here, in his little realm, it was plain that
efficiency reigned.&nbsp; Everything was spotless and in order,
and I could have wished and wished vainly for a more noiseless
servant than he ashore.&nbsp; His face, as he regarded me, had as
little or as much expression as the Sphinx.&nbsp; But his slant,
black eyes were bright, with intelligence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of the crew?&rdquo; I asked, in order
to put words to my invasion of his castle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buggy-house,&rdquo; he answered promptly, with a
disgusted shake of the head.&nbsp; &ldquo;Too much
buggy-house.&nbsp; All crazy.&nbsp; You see.&nbsp; No good.&nbsp;
Rotten.&nbsp; Down to hell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was all, but it verified my own judgment.&nbsp; While it
might be true, as Miss West had said, that every ship&rsquo;s
crew contained several lunatics and idiots, it was a foregone
conclusion that our crew contained far more than several.&nbsp;
In fact, and as it was to turn out, our crew, even in these
degenerate sailing days, was an unusual crew in so far as its
helplessness and worthlessness were beyond the average.</p>
<p>I found my own room (in reality it was two rooms)
delightful.&nbsp; Wada had unpacked and stored away my entire
outfit of clothing, and had filled numerous shelves with the
library I had brought along.&nbsp; Everything was in order and
place, from my shaving outfit in the drawer beside the
wash-basin, and my sea-boots and oilskins hung ready to hand, to
my writing materials on the desk, before which a swing arm-chair,
leather-upholstered and screwed solidly to the floor, invited
me.&nbsp; My pyjamas and dressing-gown were out.&nbsp; My
slippers, in their accustomed place by the bed, also invited
me.</p>
<p>Here, aft, all was fitness, intelligence.&nbsp; On deck it was
what I have described&mdash;a nightmare spawn of creatures,
assumably human, but malformed, mentally and physically, into
caricatures of men.&nbsp; Yes, it was an unusual crew; and that
Mr. Pike and Mr. Mellaire could whip it into the efficient shape
necessary to work this vast and intricate and beautiful fabric of
a ship was beyond all seeming of possibility.</p>
<p>Depressed as I was by what I had just witnessed on deck, there
came to me, as I leaned back in my chair and opened the second
volume of George Moore&rsquo;s <i>Hail and Farewell</i>, a
premonition that the voyage was to be disastrous.&nbsp; But then,
as I looked about the room, measured its generous space, realized
that I was more comfortably situated than I had ever been on any
passenger steamer, I dismissed foreboding thoughts and caught a
pleasant vision of myself, through weeks and months, catching up
with all the necessary reading which I had so long neglected.</p>
<p>Once, I asked Wada if he had seen the crew.&nbsp; No, he
hadn&rsquo;t, but the steward had said that in all his years at
sea this was the worst crew he had ever seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He say, all crazy, no sailors, rotten,&rdquo; Wada
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;He say all big fools and bime by much
trouble.&nbsp; &lsquo;You see,&rsquo; he say all the time.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You see, You see.&rsquo;&nbsp; He pretty old
man&mdash;fifty-five years, he say.&nbsp; Very smart man for
Chinaman.&nbsp; Just now, first time for long time, he go to
sea.&nbsp; Before, he have big business in San Francisco.&nbsp;
Then he get much trouble&mdash;police.&nbsp; They say he opium
smuggle.&nbsp; Oh, big, big trouble.&nbsp; But he catch good
lawyer.&nbsp; He no go to jail.&nbsp; But long time lawyer work,
and when trouble all finish lawyer got all his business, all his
money, everything.&nbsp; Then he go to sea, like before.&nbsp; He
make good money.&nbsp; He get sixty-five dollars a month on this
ship.&nbsp; But he don&rsquo;t like.&nbsp; Crew all crazy.&nbsp;
When this time finish he leave ship, go back start business in
San Francisco.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later, when I had Wada open one of the ports for ventilation,
I could hear the gurgle and swish of water alongside, and I knew
the anchor was up and that we were in the grip of the
<i>Britannia</i>, towing down the Chesapeake to sea.&nbsp; The
idea suggested itself that it was not too late.&nbsp; I could
very easily abandon the adventure and return to Baltimore on the
<i>Britannia</i> when she cast off the <i>Elsinore</i>.&nbsp; And
then I heard a slight tinkling of china from the pantry as the
steward proceeded to set the table, and, also, it was so warm and
comfortable, and George Moore was so irritatingly
fascinating.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<p>In every way dinner proved up beyond my expectations, and I
registered a note that the cook, whoever or whatever he might be,
was a capable man at his trade.&nbsp; Miss West served, and,
though she and the steward were strangers, they worked together
splendidly.&nbsp; I should have thought, from the smoothness of
the service, that he was an old house servant who for years had
known her every way.</p>
<p>The pilot ate in the chart-house, so that at table were the
four of us that would always be at table together.&nbsp; Captain
West and his daughter faced each other, while I, on the
captain&rsquo;s right, faced Mr. Pike.&nbsp; This put Miss West
across the corner on my right.</p>
<p>Mr. Pike, his dark sack coat (put on for the meal) bulging and
wrinkling over the lumps of muscles that padded his stooped
shoulders, had nothing at all to say.&nbsp; But he had eaten too
many years at captains&rsquo; tables not to have proper table
manners.&nbsp; At first I thought he was abashed by Miss
West&rsquo;s presence.&nbsp; Later, I decided it was due to the
presence of the captain.&nbsp; For Captain West had a way with
him that I was beginning to learn.&nbsp; Far removed as Mr. Pike
and Mr. Mellaire were from the sailors, individuals as they were
of an entirely different and superior breed, yet equally as
different and far removed from his officers was Captain
West.&nbsp; He was a serene and absolute aristocrat.&nbsp; He
neither talked &ldquo;ship&rdquo; nor anything else to Mr.
Pike.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Captain West&rsquo;s attitude toward me was
that of a social equal.&nbsp; But then, I was a passenger.&nbsp;
Miss West treated me the same way, but unbent more to Mr.
Pike.&nbsp; And Mr. Pike, answering her with &ldquo;Yes,
Miss,&rdquo; and &ldquo;No, Miss,&rdquo; ate good-manneredly and
with his shaggy-browed gray eyes studied me across the
table.&nbsp; I, too, studied him.&nbsp; Despite his violent past,
killer and driver that he was, I could not help liking the
man.&nbsp; He was honest, genuine.&nbsp; Almost more than for
that, I liked him for the spontaneous boyish laugh he gave on the
occasions when I reached the points of several funny
stories.&nbsp; No man could laugh like that and be all bad.&nbsp;
I was glad that it was he, and not Mr. Mellaire, who was to sit
opposite throughout the voyage.&nbsp; And I was very glad that
Mr. Mellaire was not to eat with us at all.</p>
<p>I am afraid that Miss West and I did most of the
talking.&nbsp; She was breezy, vivacious, tonic, and I noted
again that the delicate, almost fragile oval of her face was
given the lie by her body.&nbsp; She was a robust, healthy young
woman.&nbsp; That was undeniable.&nbsp; Not fat&mdash;heaven
forbid!&mdash;not even plump; yet her lines had that swelling
roundness that accompanies long, live muscles.&nbsp; She was
full-bodied, vigorous; and yet not so full-bodied as she
seemed.&nbsp; I remember with what surprise, when we arose from
table, I noted her slender waist.&nbsp; At that moment I got the
impression that she was willowy.&nbsp; And willowy she was, with
a normal waist and with, in addition, always that informing
bodily vigour that made her appear rounder and robuster than she
really was.</p>
<p>It was the health of her that interested me.&nbsp; When I
studied her face more closely I saw that only the lines of the
oval of it were delicate.&nbsp; Delicate it was not, nor
fragile.&nbsp; The flesh was firm, and the texture of the skin
was firm and fine as it moved over the firm muscles of face and
neck.&nbsp; The neck was a beautiful and adequate pillar of
white.&nbsp; Its flesh was firm, its skin fine, and it was
muscular.&nbsp; The hands, too, attracted me&mdash;not small, but
well-shaped, fine, white and strong, and well cared for.&nbsp; I
could only conclude that she was an unusual captain&rsquo;s
daughter, just as her father was an unusual captain and
man.&nbsp; And their noses were alike, just the hint-touch of the
beak of power and race.</p>
<p>While Miss West was telling of the unexpectedness of the
voyage, of how suddenly she had decided to come&mdash;she
accounted for it as a whim&mdash;and while she told of all the
complications she had encountered in her haste of preparation, I
found myself casting up a tally of the efficient ones on board
the <i>Elsinore</i>.&nbsp; They were Captain West and his
daughter, the two mates, myself, of course, Wada and the steward,
and, beyond the shadow of a doubt, the cook.&nbsp; The dinner
vouched for him.&nbsp; Thus I found our total of efficients to be
eight.&nbsp; But the cook, the steward, and Wada were servants,
not sailors, while Miss West and myself were
supernumeraries.&nbsp; Remained to work, direct, do, but three
efficients out of a total ship&rsquo;s company of
forty-five.&nbsp; I had no doubt that other efficients there
were; it seemed impossible that my first impression of the crew
should be correct.&nbsp; There was the carpenter.&nbsp; He might,
at his trade, be as good as the cook.&nbsp; Then the two
sailmakers, whom I had not yet seen, might prove up.</p>
<p>A little later during the meal I ventured to talk about what
had interested me and aroused my admiration, namely, the
masterfulness with which Mr. Pike and Mr. Mellaire had gripped
hold of that woeful, worthless crew.&nbsp; It was all new to me,
I explained, but I appreciated the need of it.&nbsp; As I led up
to the occurrence on Number Two hatch, when Mr. Pike had lifted
up Larry and toppled him back with a mere slap from the ends of
his fingers, I saw in Mr. Pike&rsquo;s eyes a warning, almost
threatening, expression.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I completed my
description of the episode.</p>
<p>When I had quite finished there was a silence.&nbsp; Miss West
was busy serving coffee from a copper percolator.&nbsp; Mr. Pike,
profoundly occupied with cracking walnuts, could not quite hide
the wicked, little, half-humorous, half-revengeful gleam in his
eyes.&nbsp; But Captain West looked straight at me, but from oh!
such a distance&mdash;millions and millions of miles away.&nbsp;
His clear blue eyes were as serene as ever, his tones as low and
soft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the one rule I ask to be observed, Mr.
Pathurst&mdash;we never discuss the sailors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a facer to me, and with quite a pronounced
fellow-feeling for Larry I hurriedly added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was not merely the discipline that interested
me.&nbsp; It was the feat of strength.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sailors are trouble enough without our hearing about
them, Mr. Pathurst,&rdquo; Captain West went on, as evenly and
imperturbably as if I had not spoken.&nbsp; &ldquo;I leave the
handling of the sailors to my officers.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s their
business, and they are quite aware that I tolerate no undeserved
roughness or severity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Pike&rsquo;s harsh face carried the faintest shadow of an
amused grin as he stolidly regarded the tablecloth.&nbsp; I
glanced to Miss West for sympathy.&nbsp; She laughed frankly, and
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, father never has any sailors.&nbsp; And
it&rsquo;s a good plan, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very good plan,&rdquo; Mr. Pike muttered.</p>
<p>Then Miss West kindly led the talk away from that subject, and
soon had us laughing with a spirited recital of a recent
encounter of hers with a Boston cab-driver.</p>
<p>Dinner over, I stepped to my room in quest of cigarettes, and
incidentally asked Wada about the cook.&nbsp; Wada was always a
great gatherer of information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His name Louis,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
Chinaman, too.&nbsp; No; only half Chinaman.&nbsp; Other half
Englishman.&nbsp; You know one island Napoleon he stop long time
and bime by die that island?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;St. Helena,&rdquo; I prompted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that place Louis he born.&nbsp; He talk very good
English.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment, entering the hall from the deck, Mr. Mellaire,
just relieved by the mate, passed me on his way to the big room
in the stern where the second table was set.&nbsp; His
&ldquo;Good evening, sir,&rdquo; was as stately and courteous as
any southern gentleman of the old days could have uttered
it.&nbsp; And yet I could not like the man.&nbsp; His outward
seeming was so at variance with the personality that resided
within.&nbsp; Even as he spoke and smiled I felt that from inside
his skull he was watching me, studying me.&nbsp; And somehow, in
a flash of intuition, I knew not why, I was reminded of the three
strange young men, routed last from the forecastle, to whom Mr.
Pike had read the law.&nbsp; They, too, had given me a similar
impression.</p>
<p>Behind Mr. Mellaire slouched a self-conscious, embarrassed
individual, with the face of a stupid boy and the body of a
giant.&nbsp; His feet were even larger than Mr. Pike&rsquo;s, but
the hands&mdash;I shot a quick glance to see&mdash;were not so
large as Mr. Pike&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>As they passed I looked inquiry to Wada.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He carpenter.&nbsp; He sat second table.&nbsp; His name
Sam Lavroff.&nbsp; He come from New York on ship.&nbsp; Steward
say he very young for carpenter, maybe twenty-two, three years
old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I approached the open port over my desk I again heard the
swish and gurgle of water and again realized that we were under
way.&nbsp; So steady and noiseless was our progress, that, say
seated at table, it never entered one&rsquo;s head that we were
moving or were anywhere save on the solid land. I had been used
to steamers all my life, and it was difficult immediately to
adjust myself to the absence of the propeller-thrust
vibration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you think?&rdquo; I asked Wada, who, like
myself, had never made a sailing-ship voyage.</p>
<p>He smiled politely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very funny ship.&nbsp; Very funny sailors. I
don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; Mebbe all right.&nbsp; We see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think trouble?&rdquo; I asked pointedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think sailors very funny,&rdquo; he evaded.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<p>Having lighted my cigarette, I strolled for&rsquo;ard along
the deck to where work was going on.&nbsp; Above my head dim
shapes of canvas showed in the starlight. Sail was being made,
and being made slowly, as I might judge, who was only the veriest
tyro in such matters.&nbsp; The indistinguishable shapes of men,
in long lines, pulled on ropes.&nbsp; They pulled in sick and
dogged silence, though Mr. Pike, ubiquitous, snarled out orders
and rapped out oaths from every angle upon their miserable
heads.</p>
<p>Certainly, from what I had read, no ship of the old days ever
proceeded so sadly and blunderingly to sea.&nbsp; Ere long Mr.
Mellaire joined Mr. Pike in the struggle of directing the
men.&nbsp; It was not yet eight in the evening, and all hands
were at work.&nbsp; They did not seem to know the ropes.&nbsp;
Time and again, when the half-hearted suggestions of the bosuns
had been of no avail, I saw one or the other of the mates leap to
the rail and put the right rope in the hands of the men.</p>
<p>These, on the deck, I concluded, were the hopeless ones.&nbsp;
Up aloft, from sounds and cries, I knew were other men,
undoubtedly those who were at least a little seaman-like, loosing
the sails.</p>
<p>But on deck!&nbsp; Twenty or thirty of the poor devils, tailed
on a rope that hoisted a yard, would pull without concerted
effort and with painfully slow movements.&nbsp; &ldquo;Walk away
with it!&rdquo; Mr. Pike would yell.&nbsp; And perhaps for two or
three yards they would manage to walk with the rope ere they came
to a halt like stalled horses on a hill.&nbsp; And yet, did
either of the mates spring in and add his strength, they were
able to move right along the deck without stopping.&nbsp; Either
of the mates, old men that they were, was muscularly worth
half-a-dozen of the wretched creatures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is what sailin&rsquo;s come to,&rdquo; Mr. Pike
paused to snort in my ear.&nbsp; &ldquo;This ain&rsquo;t the
place for an officer down here pulling and hauling.&nbsp; But
what can you do when the bosuns are worse than the
men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought sailors sang songs when they pulled,&rdquo; I
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure they do.&nbsp; Want to hear &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I knew there was malice of some sort in his voice, but I
answered that I&rsquo;d like to very much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, you bosun!&rdquo; Mr. Pike snarled.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Wake up!&nbsp; Start a song!&nbsp; Topsail
halyards!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the pause that followed I could have sworn that Sundry
Buyers was pressing his hands against his abdomen, while Nancy,
infinite bleakness freezing upon his face, was wetting his lips
to begin.</p>
<p>Nancy it was who began, for from no other man, I was
confident, could have issued so sepulchral a plaint.&nbsp; It was
unmusical, unbeautiful, unlively, and indescribably
doleful.&nbsp; Yet the words showed that it should have ripped
and crackled with high spirits and lawlessness, for the words
poor Nancy sang were:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Away, way, way, yar,<br />
We&rsquo;ll kill Paddy Doyle for bus boots.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Quit it!&nbsp; Quit it!&rdquo; Mr. Pike roared.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This ain&rsquo;t a funeral!&nbsp; Ain&rsquo;t there one of
you that can sing?&nbsp; Come on, now!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a
topsail-yard&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off to leap in to the pin-rail and get the wrong
ropes out of the men&rsquo;s hands to put into them the right
rope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, bosun!&nbsp; Break her out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then out of the gloom arose Sundry Buyers&rsquo; voice,
cracked and crazy and even more lugubrious than
Nancy&rsquo;s:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Then up aloft that yard must go,<br />
Whiskey for my Johnny.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second line was supposed to be the chorus, but not more
than two men feebly mumbled it.&nbsp; Sundry Buyers quavered the
next line:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Oh, whiskey killed my sister
Sue.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then Mr. Pike took a hand, seizing the hauling-part next to
the pin and lifting his voice with a rare snap and
devilishness:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And whiskey killed the old man, too,<br />
Whiskey for my Johnny.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He sang the devil-may-care lines on and on, lifting the crew
to the work and to the chorused emphasis of &ldquo;Whiskey for my
Johnny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And to his voice they pulled, they moved, they sang, and were
alive, until he interrupted the song to cry
&ldquo;Belay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then all the life and lilt went out of them, and they were
again maundering and futile things, getting in one
another&rsquo;s way, stumbling and shuffling through the
darkness, hesitating to grasp ropes, and, when they did take
hold, invariably taking hold of the wrong rope first.&nbsp;
Skulkers there were among them, too; and once, from for&rsquo;ard
of the &rsquo;midship house, I heard smacks, and curses, and
groans, and out of the darkness hurriedly emerged two men, on
their heels Mr. Pike, who chanted a recital of the distressing
things that would befall them if he caught them at such tricks
again.</p>
<p>The whole thing was too depressing for me to care to watch
further, so I strolled aft and climbed the poop.&nbsp; In the lee
of the chart-house Captain West and the pilot were pacing slowly
up and down.&nbsp; Passing on aft, I saw steering at the wheel
the weazened little old man I had noted earlier in the day.&nbsp;
In the light of the binnacle his small blue eyes looked more
malevolent than ever.&nbsp; So weazened and tiny was he, and so
large was the brass-studded wheel, that they seemed of a
height.&nbsp; His face was withered, scorched, and wrinkled, and
in all seeming he was fifty years older than Mr. Pike.&nbsp; He
was the most remarkable figure of a burnt-out, aged man one would
expect to find able seaman on one of the proudest sailing-ships
afloat.&nbsp; Later, through Wada, I was to learn that his name
was Andy Fay and that he claimed no more years than
sixty-three.</p>
<p>I leaned against the rail in the lee of the wheel-house, and
stared up at the lofty spars and myriad ropes that I could guess
were there.&nbsp; No, I decided I was not keen on the
voyage.&nbsp; The whole atmosphere of it was wrong.&nbsp; There
were the cold hours I had waited on the pier-ends.&nbsp; There
was Miss West coming along.&nbsp; There was the crew of broken
men and lunatics.&nbsp; I wondered if the wounded Greek in the
&rsquo;midship house still gibbered, and if Mr. Pike had yet
sewed him up; and I was quite sure I would not care to witness
such a transaction in surgery.</p>
<p>Even Wada, who had never been in a sailing-ship, had his
doubts of the voyage.&nbsp; So had the steward, who had spent
most of a life-time in sailing-ships.&nbsp; So far as Captain
West was concerned, crews did not exist.&nbsp; And as for Miss
West, she was so abominably robust that she could not be anything
else than an optimist in such matters.&nbsp; She had always
lived; her red blood sang to her only that she would always live
and that nothing evil would ever happen to her glorious
personality.</p>
<p>Oh, trust me, I knew the way of red blood.&nbsp; Such was my
condition that the red-blood health of Miss West was virtually an
affront to me&mdash;for I knew how unthinking and immoderate such
blood could be.&nbsp; And for five months at least&mdash;there
was Mr. Pike&rsquo;s offered wager of a pound of tobacco or a
month&rsquo;s wages to that effect&mdash;I was to be pent on the
same ship with her.&nbsp; As sure as cosmic sap was cosmic sap,
just that sure was I that ere the voyage was over I should be
pestered by her making love to me.&nbsp; Please do not mistake
me.&nbsp; My certainty in this matter was due, not to any exalted
sense of my own desirableness to women, but to my anything but
exalted concept of women as instinctive huntresses of men.&nbsp;
In my experience women hunted men with quite the same blind
tropism that marks the pursuit of the sun by the sunflower, the
pursuit of attachable surfaces by the tendrils of the
grapevine.</p>
<p>Call me blas&eacute;&mdash;I do not mind, if by blas&eacute;
is meant the world-weariness, intellectual, artistic,
sensational, which can come to a young man of thirty.&nbsp; For I
was thirty, and I was weary of all these things&mdash;weary and
in doubt.&nbsp; It was because of this state that I was
undertaking the voyage.&nbsp; I wanted to get away by myself, to
get away from all these things, and, with proper perspective,
mull the matter over.</p>
<p>It sometimes seemed to me that the culmination of this
world-sickness had been brought about by the success of my
play&mdash;my first play, as every one knows.&nbsp; But it had
been such a success that it raised the doubt in my own mind, just
as the success of my several volumes of verse had raised
doubts.&nbsp; Was the public right?&nbsp; Were the critics
right?&nbsp; Surely the function of the artist was to voice life,
yet what did I know of life?</p>
<p>So you begin to glimpse what I mean by the world-sickness that
afflicted me.&nbsp; Really, I had been, and was, very sick.&nbsp;
Mad thoughts of isolating myself entirely from the world had
hounded me.&nbsp; I had even canvassed the idea of going to
Molokai and devoting the rest of my years to the lepers&mdash;I,
who was thirty years old, and healthy and strong, who had no
particular tragedy, who had a bigger income than I knew how to
spend, who by my own achievement had put my name on the lips of
men and proved myself a power to be reckoned with&mdash;I was
that mad that I had considered the lazar house for a destiny.</p>
<p>Perhaps it will be suggested that success had turned my
head.&nbsp; Very well.&nbsp; Granted.&nbsp; But the turned head
remains a fact, an incontrovertible fact&mdash;my sickness, if
you will, and a real sickness, and a fact.&nbsp; This I knew: I
had reached an intellectual and artistic climacteric, a
life-climacteric of some sort.&nbsp; And I had diagnosed my own
case and prescribed this voyage.&nbsp; And here was the
atrociously healthy and profoundly feminine Miss West
along&mdash;the very last ingredient I would have considered
introducing into my prescription.</p>
<p>A woman!&nbsp; Woman!&nbsp; Heaven knows I had been
sufficiently tormented by their persecutions to know them.&nbsp;
I leave it to you: thirty years of age, not entirely unhandsome,
an intellectual and artistic place in the world, and an income
most dazzling&mdash;why shouldn&rsquo;t women pursue me?&nbsp;
They would have pursued me had I been a hunchback, for the sake
of my artistic place alone, for the sake of my income alone.</p>
<p>Yes; and love!&nbsp; Did I not know love&mdash;lyric,
passionate, mad, romantic love?&nbsp; That, too, was of old time
with me.&nbsp; I, too, had throbbed and sung and sobbed and
sighed&mdash;yes, and known grief, and buried my dead.&nbsp; But
it was so long ago.&nbsp; How young I was&mdash;turned
twenty-four!&nbsp; And after that I had learned the bitter lesson
that even deathless grief may die; and I had laughed again and
done my share of philandering with the pretty, ferocious moths
that fluttered around the light of my fortune and artistry; and
after that, in turn, I had retired disgusted from the lists of
woman, and gone on long lance-breaking adventures in the realm of
mind.&nbsp; And here I was, on board the <i>Elsinore</i>,
unhorsed by my encounters with the problems of the ultimate,
carried off the field with a broken pate.</p>
<p>As I leaned against the rail, dismissing premonitions of
disaster, I could not help thinking of Miss West below, bustling
and humming as she made her little nest.&nbsp; And from her my
thought drifted on to the everlasting mystery of woman.&nbsp;
Yes, I, with all the futuristic contempt for woman, am ever
caught up afresh by the mystery of woman.</p>
<p>Oh, no illusions, thank you.&nbsp; Woman, the love-seeker,
obsessing and possessing, fragile and fierce, soft and venomous,
prouder than Lucifer and as prideless, holds a perpetual, almost
morbid, attraction for the thinker.&nbsp; What is this flame of
her, blazing through all her contradictions and
ignobilities?&mdash;this ruthless passion for life, always for
life, more life on the planet?&nbsp; At times it seems to me
brazen, and awful, and soulless.&nbsp; At times I am made
petulant by it.&nbsp; And at other times I am swayed by the
sublimity of it.&nbsp; No; there is no escape from woman.&nbsp;
Always, as a savage returns to a dark glen where goblins are and
gods may be, so do I return to the contemplation of woman.</p>
<p>Mr. Pike&rsquo;s voice interrupted my musings.&nbsp; From
for&rsquo;ard, on the main deck, I heard him snarl:</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the main-topsail-yard, there!&mdash;if you cut that
gasket I&rsquo;ll split your damned skull!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again he called, with a marked change of voice, and the Henry
he called to I concluded was the training-ship boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, Henry, main-skysail-yard, there!&rdquo; he
cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make those gaskets up!&nbsp;
Fetch &rsquo;em in along the yard and make fast to the
tye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus routed from my reverie, I decided to go below to
bed.&nbsp; As my hand went out to the knob of the chart-house
door again the mate&rsquo;s voice rang out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, you gentlemen&rsquo;s sons in disguise!&nbsp;
Wake up!&nbsp; Lively now!&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<p>I did not sleep well.&nbsp; To begin with, I read late.&nbsp;
Not till two in the morning did I reach up and turn out the
kerosene reading-lamp which Wada had purchased and installed for
me.&nbsp; I was asleep immediately&mdash;perfect sleep being
perhaps my greatest gift; but almost immediately I was awake
again.&nbsp; And thereafter, with dozings and cat-naps and
restless tossings, I struggled to win to sleep, then gave it
up.&nbsp; For of all things, in my state of jangled nerves, to be
afflicted with hives!&nbsp; And still again, to be afflicted with
hives in cold winter weather!</p>
<p>At four I lighted up and went to reading, forgetting my
irritated skin in Vernon Lee&rsquo;s delightful screed against
William James, and his &ldquo;will to believe.&rdquo;&nbsp; I was
on the weather side of the ship, and from overhead, through the
deck, came the steady footfalls of some officer on watch.&nbsp; I
knew that they were not the steps of Mr. Pike, and wondered
whether they were Mr. Mellaire&rsquo;s or the
pilot&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Somebody above there was awake.&nbsp; The
work was going on, the vigilant seeing and overseeing, that, I
could plainly conclude, would go on through every hour of all the
hours on the voyage.</p>
<p>At half-past four I heard the steward&rsquo;s alarm go off,
instantly suppressed, and five minutes later I lifted my hand to
motion him in through my open door.&nbsp; What I desired was a
cup of coffee, and Wada had been with me through too many years
for me to doubt that he had given the steward precise
instructions and turned over to him my coffee and my
coffee-making apparatus.</p>
<p>The steward was a jewel.&nbsp; In ten minutes he served me
with a perfect cup of coffee.&nbsp; I read on until daylight, and
half-past eight found me, breakfast in bed finished, dressed and
shaved, and on deck.&nbsp; We were still towing, but all sails
were set to a light favouring breeze from the north.&nbsp; In the
chart-room Captain West and the pilot were smoking cigars.&nbsp;
At the wheel I noted what I decided at once was an
efficient.&nbsp; He was not a large man; if anything he was
undersized.&nbsp; But his countenance was broad-browed and
intelligently formed.&nbsp; Tom, I later learned, was his
name&mdash;Tom Spink, an Englishman.&nbsp; He was blue-eyed,
fair-skinned, well-grizzled, and, to the eye, a hale fifty years
of age.&nbsp; His reply of &ldquo;Good morning, sir&rdquo; was
cheery, and he smiled as he uttered the simple phrase.&nbsp; He
did not look sailor-like, as did Henry, the training-ship boy;
and yet I felt at once that he was a sailor, and an able one.</p>
<p>It was Mr. Pike&rsquo;s watch, and on asking him about Tom he
grudgingly admitted that the man was the &ldquo;best of the
boiling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss West emerged from the chart-house, with a rosy morning
face and her vital, springy limb-movement, and immediately began
establishing her contacts.&nbsp; On asking how I had slept, and
when I said wretchedly, she demanded an explanation.&nbsp; I told
her of my affliction of hives and showed her the lumps on my
wrists.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your blood needs thinning and cooling,&rdquo; she
adjudged promptly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wait a minute.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
see what can be done for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with that she was away and below and back in a trice, in
her hand a part glass of water into which she stirred a
teaspoonful of cream of tartar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drink it,&rdquo; she ordered, as a matter of
course.</p>
<p>I drank it.&nbsp; And at eleven in the morning she came up to
my deck-chair with a second dose of the stuff.&nbsp; Also she
reproached me soundly for permitting Wada to feed meat to
Possum.&nbsp; It was from her that Wada and I learned how mortal
a sin it was to give meat to a young puppy.&nbsp; Furthermore,
she laid down the law and the diet for Possum, not alone to me
and Wada, but to the steward, the carpenter, and Mr.
Mellaire.&nbsp; Of the latter two, because they ate by themselves
in the big after-room and because Possum played there, she was
especially suspicious; and she was outspoken in voicing her
suspicions to their faces.&nbsp; The carpenter mumbled
embarrassed asseverations in broken English of past, present, and
future innocence, the while he humbly scraped and shuffled before
her on his huge feet.&nbsp; Mr. Mellaire&rsquo;s protestations
were of the same nature, save that they were made with the grace
and suavity of a Chesterfield.</p>
<p>In short, Possum&rsquo;s diet raised quite a tempest in the
<i>Elsinore</i> teapot, and by the time it was over Miss West had
established this particular contact with me and given me a
feeling that we were the mutual owners of the puppy.&nbsp; I
noticed, later in the day, that it was to Miss West that Wada
went for instructions as to the quantity of warm water he must
use to dilute Possum&rsquo;s condensed milk.</p>
<p>Lunch won my continued approbation of the cook.&nbsp; In the
afternoon I made a trip for&rsquo;ard to the galley to make his
acquaintance.&nbsp; To all intents he was a Chinese, until he
spoke, whereupon, measured by speech alone, he was an
Englishman.&nbsp; In fact, so cultured was his speech that I can
fairly say it was vested with an Oxford accent.&nbsp; He, too,
was old, fully sixty&mdash;he acknowledged fifty-nine.&nbsp;
Three things about him were markedly conspicuous: his smile, that
embraced all of his clean-shaven Asiatic face and Asiatic eyes;
his even-rowed, white, and perfect teeth, which I deemed false
until Wada ascertained otherwise for me; and his hands and
feet.&nbsp; It was his hands, ridiculously small and beautifully
modelled, that led my scrutiny to his feet.&nbsp; They, too, were
ridiculously small and very neatly, almost dandifiedly, shod.</p>
<p>We had put the pilot off at midday, but the <i>Britannia</i>
towed us well into the afternoon and did not cast us off until
the ocean was wide about us and the land a faint blur on the
western horizon.&nbsp; Here, at the moment of leaving the tug, we
made our &ldquo;departure&rdquo;&mdash;that is to say,
technically began the voyage, despite the fact that we had
already travelled a full twenty-four hours away from
Baltimore.</p>
<p>It was about the time of casting off, when I was leaning on
the poop-rail gazing for&rsquo;ard, when Miss West joined
me.&nbsp; She had been busy below all day, and had just come up,
as she put it, for a breath of air.&nbsp; She surveyed the sky in
weather-wise fashion for a full five minutes, then remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The barometer&rsquo;s very high&mdash;30 degrees
60.&nbsp; This light north wind won&rsquo;t last.&nbsp; It will
either go into a calm or work around into a north-east
gale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which would you prefer?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gale, by all means.&nbsp; It will help us off the
land, and it will put me through my torment of sea-sickness more
quickly.&nbsp; Oh, yes,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a good
sailor, but I do suffer dreadfully at the beginning of every
voyage.&nbsp; You probably won&rsquo;t see me for a couple of
days now.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve been so busy getting
settled first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord Nelson, I have read, never got over his
squeamishness at sea,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve seen father sea-sick on occasion,&rdquo;
she answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, and some of the strongest,
hardest sailors I have ever known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Pike here joined us for a moment, ceasing from his
everlasting pacing up and down to lean with us on the
poop-rail.</p>
<p>Many of the crew were in evidence, pulling on ropes on the
main deck below us.&nbsp; To my inexperienced eye they appeared
more unprepossessing than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pretty scraggly crew, Mr. Pike,&rdquo; Miss West
remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The worst ever,&rdquo; he growled, &ldquo;and
I&rsquo;ve seen some pretty bad ones.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re
teachin&rsquo; them the ropes just now&mdash;most of
&rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They look starved,&rdquo; I commented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are, they almost always are,&rdquo; Miss West
answered, and her eyes roved over them in the same appraising,
cattle-buyer&rsquo;s fashion I had marked in Mr. Pike.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But they&rsquo;ll fatten up with regular hours, no
whiskey, and solid food&mdash;won&rsquo;t they, Mr.
Pike?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sure.&nbsp; They always do.&nbsp; And you&rsquo;ll
see them liven up when we get &rsquo;em in hand . . .
maybe.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re a measly lot, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked aloft at the vast towers of canvas.&nbsp; Our four
masts seemed to have flowered into all the sails possible, yet
the sailors beneath us, under Mr. Mellaire&rsquo;s direction,
were setting triangular sails, like jibs, between the masts, and
there were so many that they overlapped one another.&nbsp; The
slowness and clumsiness with which the men handled these small
sails led me to ask:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what would you do, Mr. Pike, with a green crew like
this, if you were caught right now in a storm with all this
canvas spread?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders, as if I had asked what he would do
in an earthquake with two rows of New York skyscrapers falling on
his head from both sides of a street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do?&rdquo; Miss West answered for him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We&rsquo;d get the sail off.&nbsp; Oh, it can be done, Mr.
Pathurst, with any kind of a crew.&nbsp; If it couldn&rsquo;t, I
should have been drowned long ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Mr. Pike upheld her.&nbsp; &ldquo;So would
I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The officers can perform miracles with the most
worthless sailors, in a pinch,&rdquo; Miss West went on.</p>
<p>Again Mr. Pike nodded his head and agreed, and I noted his two
big paws, relaxed the moment before and drooping over the rail,
quite unconsciously tensed and folded themselves into
fists.&nbsp; Also, I noted fresh abrasions on the knuckles.&nbsp;
Miss West laughed heartily, as from some recollection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember one time when we sailed from San Francisco
with a most hopeless crew.&nbsp; It was in the <i>Lallah
Rookh</i>&mdash;you remember her, Mr. Pike?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father&rsquo;s fifth command,&rdquo; he
nodded.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lost on the West Coast afterwards&mdash;went
ashore in that big earthquake and tidal wave.&nbsp; Parted her
anchors, and when she hit under the cliff, the cliff fell on
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the ship.&nbsp; Well, our crew seemed
mostly cow-boys, and bricklayers, and tramps, and more tramps
than anything else.&nbsp; Where the boarding-house masters got
them was beyond imagining.&nbsp; A number of them were
shanghaied, that was certain.&nbsp; You should have seen them
when they were first sent aloft.&rdquo;&nbsp; Again she
laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was better than circus clowns.&nbsp; And
scarcely had the tug cast us off, outside the Heads, when it
began to blow up and we began to shorten down.&nbsp; And then our
mates performed miracles.&nbsp; You remember Mr.
Harding&mdash;Silas Harding?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I though!&rdquo; Mr. Pike proclaimed
enthusiastically.&nbsp; &ldquo;He was some man, and he must have
been an old man even then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was, and a terrible man,&rdquo; she concurred, and
added, almost reverently: &ldquo;And a wonderful
man.&rdquo;&nbsp; She turned her face to me.&nbsp; &ldquo;He was
our mate.&nbsp; The men were sea-sick and miserable and
green.&nbsp; But Mr. Harding got the sail off the <i>Lallah
Rookh</i> just the same.&nbsp; What I wanted to tell you was
this:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was on the poop, just like I am now, and Mr. Harding
had a lot of those miserable sick men putting gaskets on the
main-lower-topsail.&nbsp; How far would that be above the deck,
Mr. Pike?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see . . . the <i>Lallah Rookh</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Mr. Pike paused to consider.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, say around a
hundred feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw it myself.&nbsp; One of the green hands, a
tramp&mdash;and he must already have got a taste of Mr.
Harding&mdash;fell off the lower-topsail-yard.&nbsp; I was only a
little girl, but it looked like certain death, for he was falling
from the weather side of the yard straight down on deck.&nbsp;
But he fell into the belly of the mainsail, breaking his fall,
turned a somersault, and landed on his feet on deck and
unhurt.&nbsp; And he landed right alongside of Mr. Harding,
facing him.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know which was the more
astonished, but I think Mr. Harding was, for he stood there
petrified.&nbsp; He had expected the man to be killed.&nbsp; Not
so the man.&nbsp; He took one look at Mr. Harding, then made a
wild jump for the rigging and climbed right back up to that
topsail-yard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss West and the mate laughed so heartily that they scarcely
heard me say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Astonishing!&nbsp; Think of the jar to the man&rsquo;s
nerves, falling to apparent death that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d been jarred harder by Silas Harding, I
guess,&rdquo; was Mr. Pike&rsquo;s remark, with another burst of
laughter, in which Miss West joined.</p>
<p>Which was all very well in a way.&nbsp; Ships were ships, and
judging by what I had seen of our present crew harsh treatment
was necessary.&nbsp; But that a young woman of the niceness of
Miss West should know of such things and be so saturated in this
side of ship life was not nice.&nbsp; It was not nice for me,
though it interested me, I confess,&mdash;and strengthened my
grip on reality.&nbsp; Yet it meant a hardening of one&rsquo;s
fibres, and I did not like to think of Miss West being so
hardened.</p>
<p>I looked at her and could not help marking again the fineness
and firmness of her skin.&nbsp; Her hair was dark, as were her
eyebrows, which were almost straight and rather low over her long
eyes.&nbsp; Gray her eyes were, a warm gray, and very steady and
direct in expression, intelligent and alive.&nbsp; Perhaps,
taking her face as a whole, the most noteworthy expression of it
was a great calm.&nbsp; She seemed always in repose, at peace
with herself and with the external world.&nbsp; The most
beautiful feature was her eyes, framed in lashes as dark as her
brows and hair.&nbsp; The most admirable feature was her nose,
quite straight, very straight, and just the slightest trifle too
long.&nbsp; In this it was reminiscent of her father&rsquo;s
nose.&nbsp; But the perfect modelling of the bridge and nostrils
conveyed an indescribable advertisement of race and blood.</p>
<p>Hers was a slender-lipped, sensitive, sensible, and generous
mouth&mdash;generous, not so much in size, which was quite
average, but generous rather in tolerance, in power, and in
laughter.&nbsp; All the health and buoyancy of her was in her
mouth, as well as in her eyes.&nbsp; She rarely exposed her teeth
in smiling, for which purpose she seemed chiefly to employ her
eyes; but when she laughed she showed strong white teeth, even,
not babyish in their smallness, but just the firm, sensible,
normal size one would expect in a woman as healthy and normal as
she.</p>
<p>I would never have called her beautiful, and yet she possessed
many of the factors that go to compose feminine beauty.&nbsp; She
had all the beauty of colouring, a white skin that was healthy
white and that was emphasized by the darkness of her lashes,
brows, and hair.&nbsp; And, in the same way, the darkness of
lashes and brows and the whiteness of skin set off the warm gray
of her eyes.&nbsp; The forehead was, well, medium-broad and
medium high, and quite smooth.&nbsp; No lines nor hints of lines
were there, suggestive of nervousness, of blue days of depression
and white nights of insomnia.&nbsp; Oh, she bore all the marks of
the healthy, human female, who never worried nor was vexed in the
spirit of her, and in whose body every process and function was
frictionless and automatic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss West has posed to me as quite a weather
prophet,&rdquo; I said to the mate.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now what is your
forecast of our coming weather?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She ought to be,&rdquo; was Mr. Pike&rsquo;s reply as
he lifted his glance across the smooth swell of sea to the
sky.&nbsp; &ldquo;This ain&rsquo;t the first time she&rsquo;s
been on the North Atlantic in winter.&rdquo;&nbsp; He debated a
moment, as he studied the sea and sky.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should say,
considering the high barometer, we ought to get a mild gale from
the north-east or a calm, with the chances in favour of the
calm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She favoured me with a triumphant smile, and suddenly clutched
the rail as the <i>Elsinore</i> lifted on an unusually large
swell and sank into the trough with a roll from windward that
flapped all the sails in hollow thunder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The calm has it,&rdquo; Miss West said, with just a
hint of grimness.&nbsp; &ldquo;And if this keeps up I&rsquo;ll be
in my bunk in about five minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She waved aside all sympathy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t
bother about me, Mr. Pathurst.&nbsp; Sea-sickness is only
detestable and horrid, like sleet, and muddy weather, and poison
ivy; besides, I&rsquo;d rather be sea-sick than have the
hives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something went wrong with the men below us on the deck, some
stupidity or blunder that was made aware to us by Mr.
Mellaire&rsquo;s raised voice.&nbsp; Like Mr. Pike, he had a way
of snarling at the sailors that was distinctly unpleasant to the
ear.</p>
<p>On the faces of several of the sailors bruises were in
evidence.&nbsp; One, in particular, had an eye so swollen that it
was closed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks as if he had run against a stanchion in the
dark,&rdquo; I observed.</p>
<p>Most eloquent, and most unconscious, was the quick flash of
Miss West&rsquo;s eyes to Mr. Pike&rsquo;s big paws, with freshly
abraded knuckles, resting on the rail.&nbsp; It was a stab of
hurt to me.&nbsp; <i>She knew</i>.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<p>That evening the three men of us had dinner alone, with racks
on the table, while the <i>Elsinore</i> rolled in the calm that
had sent Miss West to her room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t see her for a couple of days,&rdquo;
Captain West told me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Her mother was the same
way&mdash;a born sailor, but always sick at the outset of a
voyage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the shaking down.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Pike
astonished me with the longest observation I had yet heard him
utter at table.&nbsp; &ldquo;Everybody has to shake down when
they leave the land.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve got to forget the good
times on shore, and the good things money&rsquo;ll buy, and start
watch and watch, four hours on deck and four below.&nbsp; And it
comes hard, and all our tempers are strung until we can make the
change.&nbsp; Did it happen that you heard Caruso and Blanche
Arral this winter in New York, Mr. Pathurst?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I nodded, still marvelling over this spate of speech at
table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, think of hearing them, and Homer, and
Witherspoon, and Amato, every night for nights and nights at the
Metropolitan; and then to give it the go-by, and get to sea and
shake down to watch and watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like the sea?&rdquo; I queried.</p>
<p>He sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; But of course the sea is all
I know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except music,&rdquo; I threw in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but the sea and all the long-voyaging has cheated
me out of most of the music I oughta have had coming to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ve heard Schumann Heink?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful, wonderful!&rdquo; he murmured fervently,
then regarded me with an eager wistfulness.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve half-a-dozen of her records, and I&rsquo;ve got
the second dog-watch below.&nbsp; If Captain West don&rsquo;t
mind . . . &rdquo;&nbsp; (Captain West nodded that he
didn&rsquo;t mind).&nbsp; &ldquo;And if you&rsquo;d want to hear
them?&nbsp; The machine is a good one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then, to my amazement, when the steward had cleared the
table, this hoary old relic of man-killing and man-driving days,
battered waif of the sea that he was, carried in from his room a
most splendid collection of phonograph records.&nbsp; These, and
the machine, he placed on the table.&nbsp; The big doors were
opened, making the dining-room and the main cabin into one large
room.&nbsp; It was in the cabin that Captain West and I lolled in
big leather chairs while Mr. Pike ran the phonograph.&nbsp; His
face was in a blaze of light from the swinging lamps, and every
shade of expression was visible to me.</p>
<p>In vain I waited for him to start some popular song.&nbsp; His
records were only of the best, and the care he took of them was a
revelation.&nbsp; He handled each one reverently, as a sacred
thing, untying and unwrapping it and brushing it with a fine
camel&rsquo;s hair brush while it revolved and ere he placed the
needle on it.&nbsp; For a time all I could see was the huge brute
hands of a brute-driver, with skin off the knuckles, that
expressed love in their every movement.&nbsp; Each touch on the
discs was a caress, and while the record played he hovered over
it and dreamed in some heaven of music all his own.</p>
<p>During this time Captain West lay back and smoked a
cigar.&nbsp; His face was expressionless, and he seemed very far
away, untouched by the music.&nbsp; I almost doubted that he
heard it.&nbsp; He made no remarks between whiles, betrayed no
sign of approbation or displeasure.&nbsp; He seemed
preternaturally serene, preternaturally remote.&nbsp; And while I
watched him I wondered what his duties were.&nbsp; I had not seen
him perform any.&nbsp; Mr. Pike had attended to the loading of
the ship.&nbsp; Not until she was ready for sea had Captain West
come on board.&nbsp; I had not seen him give an order.&nbsp; It
looked to me that Mr. Pike and Mr. Mellaire did the work.&nbsp;
All Captain West did was to smoke cigars and keep blissfully
oblivious of the <i>Elsinore&rsquo;s</i> crew.</p>
<p>When Mr. Pike had played the &ldquo;Hallelujah Chorus&rdquo;
from the <i>Messiah</i>, and &ldquo;He Shall Feed His
Flock,&rdquo; he mentioned to me, almost apologetically, that he
liked sacred music, and for the reason, perhaps, that for a short
period, a child ashore in San Francisco, he had been a choir
boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then I hit the dominie over the head with a
baseball bat and sneaked off to sea again,&rdquo; he concluded
with a harsh laugh.</p>
<p>And thereat he fell to dreaming while he played
Meyerbeer&rsquo;s &ldquo;King of Heaven,&rdquo; and
Mendelssohn&rsquo;s &ldquo;O Rest in the Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When one bell struck, at quarter to eight, he carried his
music, all carefully wrapped, back into his room.&nbsp; I
lingered with him while he rolled a cigarette ere eight bells
struck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a lot more good things,&rdquo; he said
confidentially: &ldquo;Coenen&rsquo;s &lsquo;Come Unto Me,&rsquo;
and Faure&rsquo;s &lsquo;Crucifix&rsquo;; and there&rsquo;s
&lsquo;O Salutaris,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Lead, Kindly Light&rsquo;
by the Trinity Choir; and &lsquo;Jesu, Lover of My Soul&rsquo;
would just melt your heart.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll play &rsquo;em for
you some night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you believe in them?&rdquo; I was led to ask by his
rapt expression and by the picture of his brute-driving hands
which I could not shake from my consciousness.</p>
<p>He hesitated perceptibly, then replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do . . . when I&rsquo;m listening to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>My sleep that night was wretched.&nbsp; Short of sleep from
the previous night, I closed my book and turned my light off
early.&nbsp; But scarcely had I dropped into slumber when I was
aroused by the recrudescence of my hives.&nbsp; All day they had
not bothered me; yet the instant I put out the light and slept,
the damnable persistent itching set up.&nbsp; Wada had not yet
gone to bed, and from him I got more cream of tartar.&nbsp; It
was useless, however, and at midnight, when I heard the watch
changing, I partially dressed, slipped into my dressing-gown, and
went up on to the poop.</p>
<p>I saw Mr. Mellaire beginning his four hours&rsquo; watch,
pacing up and down the port side of the poop; and I slipped away
aft, past the man at the wheel, whom I did not recognize, and
took refuge in the lee of the wheel-house.</p>
<p>Once again I studied the dim loom and tracery of intricate
rigging and lofty, sail-carrying spars, thought of the mad,
imbecile crew, and experienced premonitions of disaster.&nbsp;
How could such a voyage be possible, with such a crew, on the
huge <i>Elsinore</i>, a cargo-carrier that was only a steel shell
half an inch thick burdened with five thousand tons of
coal?&nbsp; It was appalling to contemplate.&nbsp; The voyage had
gone wrong from the first.&nbsp; In the wretched unbalance that
loss of sleep brings to any good sleeper, I could decide only
that the voyage was doomed.&nbsp; Yet how doomed it was, in
truth, neither I nor a madman could have dreamed.</p>
<p>I thought of the red-blooded Miss West, who had always lived
and had no doubts but what she would always live.&nbsp; I thought
of the killing and driving and music-loving Mr. Pike.&nbsp; Many
a haler remnant than he had gone down on a last voyage.&nbsp; As
for Captain West, he did not count.&nbsp; He was too neutral a
being, too far away, a sort of favoured passenger who had nothing
to do but serenely and passively exist in some Nirvana of his own
creating.</p>
<p>Next I remembered the self-wounded Greek, sewed up by Mr. Pike
and lying gibbering between the steel walls of the
&rsquo;midship-house.&nbsp; This picture almost decided me, for
in my fevered imagination he typified the whole mad, helpless,
idiotic crew.&nbsp; Certainly I could go back to Baltimore.&nbsp;
Thank God I had the money to humour my whims.&nbsp; Had not Mr.
Pike told me, in reply to a question, that he estimated the
running expenses of the <i>Elsinore</i> at two hundred dollars a
day?&nbsp; I could afford to pay two hundred a day, or two
thousand, for the several days that might be necessary to get me
back to the land, to a pilot tug, or any inbound craft to
Baltimore.</p>
<p>I was quite wholly of a mind to go down and rout out Captain
West to tell him my decision, when another presented itself:
<i>Then are you</i>, <i>the thinker and philosopher</i>, <i>the
world-sick one</i>, <i>afraid to go down</i>, <i>to cease in the
darkness</i>?&nbsp; Bah!&nbsp; My own pride in my
life-pridelessness saved Captain West&rsquo;s sleep from
interruption.&nbsp; Of course I would go on with the adventure,
if adventure it might be called, to go sailing around Cape Horn
with a shipload of fools and lunatics&mdash;and worse; for I
remembered the three Babylonish and Semitic ones who had aroused
Mr. Pike&rsquo;s ire and who had laughed so terribly and
silently.</p>
<p>Night thoughts!&nbsp; Sleepless thoughts!&nbsp; I dismissed
them all and started below, chilled through by the cold.&nbsp;
But at the chart-room door I encountered Mr. Mellaire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pleasant evening, sir,&rdquo; he greeted me.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A pity there&rsquo;s not a little wind to help us off the
land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of the crew?&rdquo; I asked, after a
moment or so.</p>
<p>Mr. Mellaire shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen many queer crews in my time, Mr.
Pathurst.&nbsp; But I never saw one as queer as this&mdash;boys,
old men, cripples and&mdash;you saw Tony the Greek go overboard
yesterday?&nbsp; Well, that&rsquo;s only the beginning.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s a sample.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got a big Irishman in my
watch who&rsquo;s going bad.&nbsp; Did you notice a little,
dried-up Scotchman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who looks mean and angry all the time, and who was
steering the evening before last?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very one&mdash;Andy Fay.&nbsp; Well, Andy
Fay&rsquo;s just been complaining to me about
O&rsquo;Sullivan.&nbsp; Says O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s threatened
his life.&nbsp; When Andy Fay went off watch at eight he found
O&rsquo;Sullivan stropping a razor.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll give you the
conversation as Andy gave it to me:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Says O&rsquo;Sullivan to me, &ldquo;Mr. Fay,
I&rsquo;ll have a word wid yeh?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; says I; &ldquo;what can I do for
you?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Sell me your sea-boots, Mr. Fay,&rdquo;
says O&rsquo;Sullivan, polite as can be.&nbsp; &ldquo;But what
will you be wantin&rsquo; of them?&rdquo; says I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Twill be a great favour,&rdquo; says
O&rsquo;Sullivan.&nbsp; &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s my only
pair,&rdquo; says I; &ldquo;and you have a pair of your
own,&rdquo; says I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. Fay, I&rsquo;ll be
needin&rsquo; me own in bad weather,&rdquo; says
O&rsquo;Sullivan.&nbsp; &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;you
have no money.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay for them when
we pay off in Seattle,&rdquo; says O&rsquo;Sullivan.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not do it,&rdquo; says I; &ldquo;besides,
you&rsquo;re not tellin&rsquo; me what you&rsquo;ll be
doin&rsquo; with them.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;But I will tell
yeh,&rdquo; says O&rsquo;Sullivan; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m wantin&rsquo;
to throw &rsquo;em over the side.&rdquo;&nbsp; And with that I
turns to walk away, but O&rsquo;Sullivan says, very polite and
seducin&rsquo;-like, still a-stroppin&rsquo; the razor,
&ldquo;Mr. Fay,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;will you kindly step this
way an&rsquo; have your throat cut?&rdquo;&nbsp; And with that I
knew my life was in danger, and I have come to make report to
you, sir, that the man is a violent lunatic.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or soon will be,&rdquo; I remarked.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
noticed him yesterday, a big man muttering continually to
himself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the man,&rdquo; Mr. Mellaire said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you have many such at sea?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than my share, I do believe, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was lighting a cigarette at the moment, and with a quick
movement he pulled off his cap, bent his head forward, and held
up the blazing match that I might see.</p>
<p>I saw a grizzled head, the full crown of which was not
entirely bald, but partially covered with a few sparse long
hairs.&nbsp; And full across this crown, disappearing in the
thicker fringe above the ears, ran the most prodigious scar I had
ever seen.&nbsp; Because the vision of it was so fleeting, ere
the match blew out, and because of the scar&rsquo;s very
prodigiousness, I may possibly exaggerate, but I could have sworn
that I could lay two fingers deep into the horrid cleft and that
it was fully two fingers broad.&nbsp; There seemed no bone at
all, just a great fissure, a deep valley covered with skin; and I
was confident that the brain pulsed immediately under that
skin.</p>
<p>He pulled his cap on and laughed in an amused, reassuring
way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A crazy sea cook did that, Mr. Pathurst, with a
meat-axe.&nbsp; We were thousands of miles from anywhere, in the
South Indian Ocean at the time, running our Easting down, but the
cook got the idea into his addled head that we were lying in
Boston Harbour, and that I wouldn&rsquo;t let him go
ashore.&nbsp; I had my back to him at the time, and I never knew
what struck me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how could you recover from so fearful an
injury?&rdquo; I questioned.&nbsp; &ldquo;There must have been a
splendid surgeon on board, and you must have had wonderful
vitality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been the vitality . . . and the
molasses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Molasses!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; the captain had old-fashioned prejudices against
antiseptics.&nbsp; He always used molasses for fresh
wound-dressings.&nbsp; I lay in my bunk many weary weeks&mdash;we
had a long passage&mdash;and by the time we reached Hong Kong the
thing was healed, there was no need for a shore surgeon, and I
was standing my third mate&rsquo;s watch&mdash;we carried third
mates in those days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not for many a long day was I to realize the dire part that
scar in Mr. Mellaire&rsquo;s head was to play in his destiny and
in the destiny of the <i>Elsinore</i>.&nbsp; Had I known at the
time, Captain West would have received the most unusual awakening
from sleep that he ever experienced; for he would have been
routed out by a very determined, partially-dressed passenger with
a proposition capable of going to the extent of buying the
<i>Elsinore</i> outright with all her cargo, so that she might be
sailed straight back to Baltimore.</p>
<p>As it was, I merely thought it a very marvellous thing that
Mr. Mellaire should have lived so many years with such a hole in
his head.</p>
<p>We talked on, and he gave me many details of that particular
happening, and of other happenings at sea on the part of the
lunatics that seem to infest the sea.</p>
<p>And yet I could not like the man.&nbsp; In nothing he said,
nor in the manner of saying things, could I find fault.&nbsp; He
seemed generous, broad-minded, and, for a sailor, very much of a
man of the world.&nbsp; It was easy for me to overlook his
excessive suavity of speech and super-courtesy of social
mannerism.&nbsp; It was not that.&nbsp; But all the time I was
distressingly, and, I suppose, intuitively aware, though in the
darkness I couldn&rsquo;t even see his eyes, that there, behind
those eyes, inside that skull, was ambuscaded an alien
personality that spied upon me, measured me, studied me, and that
said one thing while it thought another thing.</p>
<p>When I said good night and went below it was with the feeling
that I had been talking with the one half of some sort of a dual
creature.&nbsp; The other half had not spoken.&nbsp; Yet I sensed
it there, fluttering and quick, behind the mask of words and
flesh.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<p>But I could not sleep.&nbsp; I took more cream of
tartar.&nbsp; It must be the heat of the bed-clothes, I decided,
that excited my hives.&nbsp; And yet, whenever I ceased
struggling for sleep, and lighted the lamp and read, my skin
irritation decreased.&nbsp; But as soon as I turned out the lamp
and closed my eyes I was troubled again.&nbsp; So hour after hour
passed, through which, between vain attempts to sleep, I managed
to wade through many pages of Rosny&rsquo;s <i>Le
Termite</i>&mdash;a not very cheerful proceeding, I must say,
concerned as it is with the microscopic and over-elaborate
recital of No&euml;l Servaise&rsquo;s tortured nerves, bodily
pains, and intellectual phantasma.&nbsp; At last I tossed the
novel aside, damned all analytical Frenchmen, and found some
measure of relief in the more genial and cynical Stendhal.</p>
<p>Over my head I could hear Mr. Mellaire steadily pace up and
down.&nbsp; At four the watches changed, and I recognized the
age-lag in Mr. Pike&rsquo;s promenade.&nbsp; Half an hour later,
just as the steward&rsquo;s alarm went off, instantly checked by
that light-sleeping Asiatic, the <i>Elsinore</i> began to heel
over on my side.&nbsp; I could hear Mr. Pike barking and snarling
orders, and at times a trample and shuffle of many feet passed
over my head as the weird crew pulled and hauled.&nbsp; The
<i>Elsinore</i> continued to heel over until I could see the
water against my port, and then she gathered way and dashed ahead
at such a rate that I could hear the stinging and singing of the
foam through the circle of thick glass beside me.</p>
<p>The steward brought me coffee, and I read till daylight and
after, when Wada served me breakfast and helped me dress.&nbsp;
He, too, complained of inability to sleep.&nbsp; He had been
bunked with Nancy in one of the rooms in the
&rsquo;midship-house.&nbsp; Wada described the situation.&nbsp;
The tiny room, made of steel, was air-tight when the steel door
was closed.&nbsp; And Nancy insisted on keeping the door
closed.&nbsp; As a result Wada, in the upper bunk, had
stifled.&nbsp; He told me that the air had got so bad that the
flame of the lamp, no matter how high it was turned, guttered
down and all but refused to burn.&nbsp; Nancy snored beautifully
through it all, while he had been unable to close his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is not clean,&rdquo; quoth Wada.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is
a pig.&nbsp; No more will I sleep in that place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the poop I found the <i>Elsinore</i>, with many of her
sails furled, slashing along through a troubled sea under an
overcast sky.&nbsp; Also I found Mr. Mellaire marching up and
down, just as I had left him hours before, and it took quite a
distinct effort for me to realize that he had had the watch off
between four and eight.&nbsp; Even then, he told me, he had slept
from four until half-past seven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is one thing, Mr. Pathurst, I always sleep like a
baby . . . which means a good conscience, sir, yes, a good
conscience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And while he enunciated the platitude I was uncomfortably
aware that that alien thing inside his skull was watching me,
studying me.</p>
<p>In the cabin Captain West smoked a cigar and read the
Bible.&nbsp; Miss West did not appear, and I was grateful that to
my sleeplessness the curse of sea-sickness had not been
added.</p>
<p>Without asking permission of anybody, Wada arranged a sleeping
place for himself in a far corner of the big after-room,
screening the corner with a solidly lashed wall of my trunks and
empty book boxes.</p>
<p>It was a dreary enough day, no sun, with occasional splatters
of rain and a persistent crash of seas over the weather rail and
swash of water across the deck.&nbsp; With my eyes glued to the
cabin ports, which gave for&rsquo;ard along the main deck, I
could see the wretched sailors, whenever they were given some
task of pull and haul, wet through and through by the boarding
seas.&nbsp; Several times I saw some of them taken off their feet
and rolled about in the creaming foam.&nbsp; And yet, erect,
unstaggering, with certitude of weight and strength, among these
rolled men, these clutching, cowering ones, moved either Mr. Pike
or Mr. Mellaire.&nbsp; They were never taken off their
feet.&nbsp; They never shrank away from a splash of spray or
heavier bulk of down-falling water.&nbsp; They had fed on
different food, were informed with a different spirit, were of
iron in contrast with the poor miserables they drove to their
bidding.</p>
<p>In the afternoon I dozed for half-an-hour in one of the big
chairs in the cabin.&nbsp; Had it not been for the violent motion
of the ship I could have slept there for hours, for the hives did
not trouble.&nbsp; Captain West, stretched out on the cabin sofa,
his feet in carpet slippers, slept enviably.&nbsp; By some
instinct, I might say, in the deep of sleep, he kept his place
and was not rolled off upon the floor.&nbsp; Also, he lightly
held a half-smoked cigar in one hand.&nbsp; I watched him for an
hour, and knew him to be asleep, and marvelled that he maintained
his easy posture and did not drop the cigar.</p>
<p>After dinner there was no phonograph.&nbsp; The second
dog-watch was Mr. Pike&rsquo;s on deck.&nbsp; Besides, as he
explained, the rolling was too severe.&nbsp; It would make the
needle jump and scratch his beloved records.</p>
<p>And no sleep!&nbsp; Another weary night of torment, and
another dreary, overcast day and leaden, troubled sea.&nbsp; And
no Miss West.&nbsp; Wada, too, is sea-sick, although heroically
he kept his feet and tried to tend on me with glassy, unseeing
eyes.&nbsp; I sent him to his bunk, and read through the endless
hours until my eyes were tired, and my brain, between lack of
sleep and over-use, was fuzzy.</p>
<p>Captain West is no conversationalist.&nbsp; The more I see of
him the more I am baffled.&nbsp; I have not yet found a reason
for that first impression I received of him.&nbsp; He has all the
poise and air of a remote and superior being, and yet I wonder if
it be not poise and air and nothing else.&nbsp; Just as I had
expected, that first meeting, ere he spoke a word, to hear fall
from his lips words of untold beneficence and wisdom, and then
heard him utter mere social commonplaces, so I now find myself
almost forced to conclude that his touch of race, and beak of
power, and all the tall, aristocratic slenderness of him have
nothing behind them.</p>
<p>And yet, on the other hand, I can find no reason for rejecting
that first impression.&nbsp; He has not shown any strength, but
by the same token he has not shown any weakness.&nbsp; Sometimes
I wonder what resides behind those clear blue eyes.&nbsp;
Certainly I have failed to find any intellectual backing.&nbsp; I
tried him out with William James&rsquo; <i>Varieties of Religious
Experience</i>.&nbsp; He glanced at a few pages, then returned it
to me with the frank statement that it did not interest
him.&nbsp; He has no books of his own.&nbsp; Evidently he is not
a reader.&nbsp; Then what is he?&nbsp; I dared to feel him out on
politics.&nbsp; He listened courteously, said sometimes yes and
sometimes no, and, when I ceased from very discouragement, said
nothing.</p>
<p>Aloof as the two officers are from the men, Captain West is
still more aloof from his officers.&nbsp; I have not seen him
address a further word to Mr. Mellaire than &ldquo;Good
morning&rdquo; on the poop.&nbsp; As for Mr. Pike, who eats three
times a day with him, scarcely any more conversation obtains
between them.&nbsp; And I am surprised by what seems the very
conspicuous awe with which Mr. Pike seems to regard his
commander.</p>
<p>Another thing.&nbsp; What are Captain West&rsquo;s
duties?&nbsp; So far he has done nothing, save eat three times a
day, smoke many cigars, and each day stroll a total of one mile
around the poop.&nbsp; The mates do all the work, and hard work
it is, four hours on deck and four below, day and night with
never a variation.&nbsp; I watch Captain West and am
amazed.&nbsp; He will loll back in the cabin and stare straight
before him for hours at a time, until I am almost frantic to
demand of him what are his thoughts.&nbsp; Sometimes I doubt that
he is thinking at all.&nbsp; I give him up.&nbsp; I cannot fathom
him.</p>
<p>Altogether a depressing day of rain-splatter and wash of water
across the deck.&nbsp; I can see, now, that the problem of
sailing a ship with five thousand tons of coal around the Horn is
more serious than I had thought.&nbsp; So deep is the
<i>Elsinore</i> in the water that she is like a log awash.&nbsp;
Her tall, six-foot bulwarks of steel cannot keep the seas from
boarding her.&nbsp; She has not the buoyancy one is accustomed to
ascribe to ships.&nbsp; On the contrary, she is weighted down
until she is dead, so that, for this one day alone, I am appalled
at the thought of how many thousands of tons of the North
Atlantic have boarded her and poured out through her spouting
scuppers and clanging ports.</p>
<p>Yes, a depressing day.&nbsp; The two mates have alternated on
deck and in their bunks.&nbsp; Captain West has dozed on the
cabin sofa or read the Bible.&nbsp; Miss West is still
sea-sick.&nbsp; I have tired myself out with reading, and the
fuzziness of my unsleeping brain makes for melancholy.&nbsp; Even
Wada is anything but a cheering spectacle, crawling out of his
bunk, as he does at stated intervals, and with sick, glassy eyes
trying to discern what my needs may be.&nbsp; I almost wish I
could get sea-sick myself.&nbsp; I had never dreamed that a sea
voyage could be so unenlivening as this one is proving.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<p>Another morning of overcast sky and leaden sea, and of the
<i>Elsinore</i>, under half her canvas, clanging her deck ports,
spouting water from her scuppers, and dashing eastward into the
heart of the Atlantic.&nbsp; And I have failed to sleep
half-an-hour all told.&nbsp; At this rate, in a very short time I
shall have consumed all the cream of tartar on the ship.&nbsp; I
never have had hives like these before.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t
understand it.&nbsp; So long as I keep my lamp burning and read I
am untroubled.&nbsp; The instant I put out the lamp and drowse
off the irritation starts and the lumps on my skin begin to
form.</p>
<p>Miss West may be sea-sick, but she cannot be comatose, because
at frequent intervals she sends the steward to me with more cream
of tartar.</p>
<p>I have had a revelation to-day.&nbsp; I have discovered
Captain West.&nbsp; He is a Samurai.&mdash;You remember the
Samurai that H.&nbsp; G.&nbsp; Wells describes in his <i>Modern
Utopia</i>&mdash;the superior breed of men who know things and
are masters of life and of their fellow-men in a
super-benevolent, super-wise way?&nbsp; Well, that is what
Captain West is.&nbsp; Let me tell it to you.</p>
<p>We had a shift of wind to-day.&nbsp; In the height of a
south-west gale the wind shifted, in the instant, eight points,
which is equivalent to a quarter of the circle.&nbsp; Imagine
it!&nbsp; Imagine a gale howling from out of the
south-west.&nbsp; And then imagine the wind, in a heavier and
more violent gale, abruptly smiting you from the
north-west.&nbsp; We had been sailing through a circular storm,
Captain West vouchsafed to me, before the event, and the wind
could be expected to box the compass.</p>
<p>Clad in sea-boots, oilskins and sou&rsquo;wester, I had for
some time been hanging upon the rail at the break of the poop,
staring down fascinated at the poor devils of sailors, repeatedly
up to their necks in water, or submerged, or dashed like straws
about the deck, while they pulled and hauled, stupidly, blindly,
and in evident fear, under the orders of Mr. Pike.</p>
<p>Mr. Pike was with them, working them and working with
them.&nbsp; He took every chance they took, yet somehow he
escaped being washed off his feet, though several times I saw him
entirely buried from view.&nbsp; There was more than luck in the
matter; for I saw him, twice, at the head of a line of the men,
himself next to the pin.&nbsp; And twice, in this position, I saw
the North Atlantic curl over the rail and fall upon them.&nbsp;
And each time he alone remained, holding the turn of the rope on
the pin, while the rest of them were rolled and sprawled
helplessly away.</p>
<p>Almost it seemed to me good fun, as at a circus, watching
their antics.&nbsp; But I did not apprehend the seriousness of
the situation until, the wind screaming higher than ever and the
sea a-smoke and white with wrath, two men did not get up from the
deck.&nbsp; One was carried away for&rsquo;ard with a broken
leg&mdash;it was Iare Jacobson, a dull-witted Scandinavian; and
the other, Kid Twist, was carried away, unconscious, with a
bleeding scalp.</p>
<p>In the height of the gusts, in my high position, where the
seas did not break, I found myself compelled to cling tightly to
the rail to escape being blown away.&nbsp; My face was stung to
severe pain by the high-driving spindrift, and I had a feeling
that the wind was blowing the cobwebs out of my sleep-starved
brain.</p>
<p>And all the time, slender, aristocratic, graceful in streaming
oilskins, in apparent unconcern, giving no orders, effortlessly
accommodating his body to the violent rolling of the
<i>Elsinore</i>, Captain West strolled up and down.</p>
<p>It was at this stage in the gale that he unbent sufficiently
to tell me that we were going through a circular storm and that
the wind was boxing the compass.&nbsp; I did notice that he kept
his gaze pretty steadily fixed on the overcast, cloud-driven
sky.&nbsp; At last, when it seemed the wind could not possibly
blow more fiercely, he found in the sky what he sought.&nbsp; It
was then that I first heard his voice&mdash;a sea-voice, clear as
a bell, distinct as silver, and of an ineffable sweetness and
volume, as it might be the trump of Gabriel.&nbsp; That
voice!&mdash;effortless, dominating!&nbsp; The mighty threat of
the storm, made articulate by the resistance of the
<i>Elsinore</i>, shouted in all the stays, bellowed in the
shrouds, thrummed the taut ropes against the steel masts, and
from the myriad tiny ropes far aloft evoked a devil&rsquo;s
chorus of shrill pipings and screechings.&nbsp; And yet, through
this bedlam of noise, came Captain West&rsquo;s voice, as of a
spirit visitant, distinct, unrelated, mellow as all music and
mighty as an archangel&rsquo;s call to judgment.&nbsp; And it
carried understanding and command to the man at the wheel, and to
Mr. Pike, waist-deep in the wash of sea below us.&nbsp; And the
man at the wheel obeyed, and Mr. Pike obeyed, barking and
snarling orders to the poor wallowing devils who wallowed on and
obeyed him in turn.&nbsp; And as the voice was the face.&nbsp;
This face I had never seen before.&nbsp; It was the face of the
spirit visitant, chaste with wisdom, lighted by a splendour of
power and calm.&nbsp; Perhaps it was the calm that smote me most
of all.&nbsp; It was as the calm of one who had crossed chaos to
bless poor sea-worn men with the word that all was well.&nbsp; It
was not the face of the fighter.&nbsp; To my thrilled imagination
it was the face of one who dwelt beyond all strivings of the
elements and broody dissensions of the blood.</p>
<p>The Samurai had arrived, in thunders and lightnings, riding
the wings of the storm, directing the gigantic, labouring
<i>Elsinore</i> in all her intricate massiveness, commanding the
wisps of humans to his will, which was the will of wisdom.</p>
<p>And then, that wonderful Gabriel voice of his, silent (while
his creatures laboured his will), unconcerned, detached and
casual, more slenderly tall and aristocratic than ever in his
streaming oilskins, Captain West touched my shoulder and pointed
astern over our weather quarter.&nbsp; I looked, and all that I
could see was a vague smoke of sea and air and a cloud-bank of
sky that tore at the ocean&rsquo;s breast.&nbsp; And at the same
moment the gale from the south-west ceased.&nbsp; There was no
gale, no moving zephyrs, nothing but a vast quietude of air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; I gasped, out of equilibrium from
the abrupt cessation of wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The shift,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;There she
comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And it came, from the north-west, a blast of wind, a blow, an
atmospheric impact that bewildered and stunned and again made the
<i>Elsinore</i> harp protest.&nbsp; It forced me down on the
rail.&nbsp; I was like a windle-straw.&nbsp; As I faced this new
abruptness of gale it drove the air back into my lungs, so that I
suffocated and turned my head aside to breathe in the lee of the
draught.&nbsp; The man at the wheel again listened to the Gabriel
voice; and Mr. Pike, on the deck below, listened and repeated the
will of the voice; and Captain West, in slender and stately
balance, leaned into the face of the wind and slowly paced the
deck.</p>
<p>It was magnificent.&nbsp; Now, and for the first time, I knew
the sea, and the men who overlord the sea.&nbsp; Captain West had
vindicated himself, exposited himself.&nbsp; At the height and
crisis of storm he had taken charge of the <i>Elsinore</i>, and
Mr. Pike had become, what in truth was all he was, the foreman of
a gang of men, the slave-driver of slaves, serving the one from
beyond&mdash;the Samurai.</p>
<p>A minute or so longer Captain West strolled up and down,
leaning easily into the face of this new and abominable gale or
resting his back against it, and then he went below, pausing for
a moment, his hand on the knob of the chart-room door, to cast a
last measuring look at the storm-white sea and wrath-sombre sky
he had mastered.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, below, passing the open cabin door, I
glanced in and saw him.&nbsp; Sea-boots and storm-trappings were
gone; his feet, in carpet slippers, rested on a hassock; while he
lay back in the big leather chair smoking dreamily, his eyes wide
open, absorbed, non-seeing&mdash;or, if they saw, seeing things
beyond the reeling cabin walls and beyond my ken.&nbsp; I have
developed an immense respect for Captain West, though now I know
him less than the little I thought I knew him before.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<p>Small wonder that Miss West remains sea-sick on an ocean like
this, which has become a factory where the veering gales
manufacture the selectest and most mountainous brands of
cross-seas.&nbsp; The way the poor <i>Elsinore</i> pitches,
plunges, rolls, and shivers, with all her lofty spars and masts
and all her five thousand tons of dead-weight cargo, is
astonishing.&nbsp; To me she is the most erratic thing
imaginable; yet Mr. Pike, with whom I now pace the poop on
occasion, tells me that coal is a good cargo, and that the
<i>Elsinore</i> is well-loaded because he saw to it himself.</p>
<p>He will pause abruptly, in the midst of his interminable
pacing, in order to watch her in her maddest antics.&nbsp; The
sight is very pleasant to him, for his eyes glisten and a faint
glow seems to irradiate his face and impart to it a hint of
ecstasy.&nbsp; The <i>Elsinore</i> has a snug place in his heart,
I am confident.&nbsp; He calls her behaviour admirable, and at
such times will repeat to me that it was he who saw to her
loading.</p>
<p>It is very curious, the habituation of this man, through a
long life on the sea, to the motion of the sea.&nbsp; There
<i>is</i> a rhythm to this chaos of crossing, buffeting
waves.&nbsp; I sense this rhythm, although I cannot solve
it.&nbsp; But Mr. Pike <i>knows</i> it.&nbsp; Again and again, as
we paced up and down this afternoon, when to me nothing unusually
antic seemed impending, he would seize my arm as I lost balance,
and as the <i>Elsinore</i> smashed down on her side and heeled
over and over with a colossal roll that seemed never to end, and
that always ended with an abrupt, snap-of-the-whip effect as she
began the corresponding roll to windward.&nbsp; In vain I strove
to learn how Mr. Pike forecasts these antics, and I am driven to
believe that he does not consciously forecast them at all.&nbsp;
He <i>feels</i> them; he knows them.&nbsp; They, and the sea, are
ingrained in him.</p>
<p>Toward the end of our little promenade I was guilty of
impatiently shaking off a sudden seizure of my arm in his big
paw.&nbsp; If ever, in an hour, the <i>Elsinore</i> had been less
gymnastic than at that moment, I had not noticed it.&nbsp; So I
shook off the sustaining clutch, and the next moment the
<i>Elsinore</i> had smashed down and buried a couple of hundred
feet of her starboard rail beneath the sea, while I had shot down
the deck and smashed myself breathless against the wall of the
chart-house.&nbsp; My ribs and one shoulder are sore from it
yet.&nbsp; Now how did he know?</p>
<p>And he never staggers nor seems in danger of being rolled
away.&nbsp; On the contrary, such a surplus of surety of balance
has he that time and again he lent his surplus to me.&nbsp; I
begin to have more respect, not for the sea, but for the men of
the sea, and not for the sweepings of seamen that are as slaves
on our decks, but for the real seamen who are their
masters&mdash;for Captain West, for Mr. Pike, yes, and for Mr.
Mellaire, dislike him as I do.</p>
<p>As early as three in the afternoon the wind, still a gale,
went back to the south-west.&nbsp; Mr. Mellaire had the deck, and
he went below and reported the change to Captain West.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll wear ship at four, Mr. Pathurst,&rdquo; the
second mate told me when he came back.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
find it an interesting manoeuvre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why wait till four?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Captain&rsquo;s orders, sir.&nbsp; The watches will
be changing, and we&rsquo;ll have the use of both of them,
without working a hardship on the watch below by calling it out
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And when both watches were on deck Captain West, again in
oilskins, came out of the chart-house.&nbsp; Mr. Pike, out on the
bridge, took charge of the many men who, on deck and on the poop,
were to manage the mizzen-braces, while Mr. Mellaire went
for&rsquo;ard with his watch to handle the fore-and
main-braces.&nbsp; It was a pretty manoeuvre, a play of
leverages, by which they cased the force of the wind on the after
part of the <i>Elsinore</i> and used the force of the wind on the
for&rsquo;ard part.</p>
<p>Captain West gave no orders whatever, and, to all intents, was
quite oblivious of what was being done.&nbsp; He was again the
favoured passenger, taking a stroll for his health&rsquo;s
sake.&nbsp; And yet I knew that both his officers were
uncomfortably aware of his presence and were keyed to their
finest seamanship.&nbsp; I know, now, Captain West&rsquo;s
position on board.&nbsp; He is the brains of the
<i>Elsinore</i>.&nbsp; He is the master strategist.&nbsp; There
is more in directing a ship on the ocean than in standing watches
and ordering men to pull and haul.&nbsp; They are pawns, and the
two officers are pieces, with which Captain West plays the game
against sea, and wind, and season, and ocean current.&nbsp; He is
the knower.&nbsp; They are his tongue, by which he makes his
knowledge articulate.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>A bad night&mdash;equally bad for the <i>Elsinore</i> and for
me.&nbsp; She is receiving a sharp buffeting at the hands of the
wintry North Atlantic.&nbsp; I fell asleep early, exhausted from
lack of sleep, and awoke in an hour, frantic with my lumped and
burning skin.&nbsp; More cream of tartar, more reading, more vain
attempts to sleep, until shortly before five, when the steward
brought me my coffee, I wrapped myself in my dressing-gown, and
like a being distracted prowled into the cabin.&nbsp; I dozed in
a leather chair and was thrown out by a violent roll of the
ship.&nbsp; I tried the sofa, sinking to sleep immediately, and
immediately thereafter finding myself precipitated to the
floor.&nbsp; I am convinced that when Captain West naps on the
sofa he is only half asleep.&nbsp; How else can he maintain so
precarious a position?&mdash;unless, in him, too, the sea and its
motion be ingrained.</p>
<p>I wandered into the dining-room, wedged myself into a screwed
chair, and fell asleep, my head on my arms, my arms on the
table.&nbsp; And at quarter past seven the steward roused me by
shaking my shoulders.&nbsp; It was time to set table.</p>
<p>Heavy with the brief heaviness of sleep I had had, I dressed
and stumbled up on to the poop in the hope that the wind would
clear my brain.&nbsp; Mr. Pike had the watch, and with sure,
age-lagging step he paced the deck.&nbsp; The man is a
marvel&mdash;sixty-nine years old, a life of hardship, and as
sturdy as a lion.&nbsp; Yet of the past night alone his hours had
been: four to six in the afternoon on deck; eight to twelve on
deck; and four to eight in the morning on deck.&nbsp; In a few
minutes he would be relieved, but at midday he would again be on
deck.</p>
<p>I leaned on the poop-rail and stared for&rsquo;ard along the
dreary waste of deck.&nbsp; Every port and scupper was working to
ease the weight of North Atlantic that perpetually fell on
board.&nbsp; Between the rush of the cascades, streaks of rust
showed everywhere.&nbsp; Some sort of a wooden pin-rail had
carried away on the starboard-rail at the foot of the
mizzen-shrouds, and an amazing raffle of ropes and tackles washed
about.&nbsp; Here Nancy and half-a-dozen men worked sporadically,
and in fear of their lives, to clear the tangle.</p>
<p>The long-suffering bleakness was very pronounced on
Nancy&rsquo;s face, and when the walls of water, in impending
downfall, reared above the <i>Elsinore&rsquo;s</i> rail, he was
always the first to leap for the life-line which had been
stretched fore and aft across the wide space of deck.</p>
<p>The rest of the men were scarcely less backward in dropping
their work and springing to safety&mdash;if safety it might be
called, to grip a rope in both hands and have legs sweep out from
under, and be wrenched full-length upon the boiling surface of an
ice-cold flood.&nbsp; Small wonder they look wretched.&nbsp; Bad
as their condition was when they came aboard at Baltimore, they
look far worse now, what of the last several days of wet and
freezing hardship.</p>
<p>From time to time, completing his for&rsquo;ard pace along the
poop, Mr. Pike would pause, ere he retraced his steps, and snort
sardonic glee at what happened to the poor devils below.&nbsp;
The man&rsquo;s heart is callous.&nbsp; A thing of iron, he has
endured; and he has no patience nor sympathy with these creatures
who lack his own excessive iron.</p>
<p>I noticed the stone-deaf man, the twisted oaf whose face I
have described as being that of an ill-treated and feeble-minded
faun.&nbsp; His bright, liquid, pain-filled eyes were more filled
with pain than ever, his face still more lean and drawn with
suffering.&nbsp; And yet his face showed an excess of
nervousness, sensitiveness, and a pathetic eagerness to please
and do.&nbsp; I could not help observing that, despite his
dreadful sense-handicap and his wrecked, frail body, he did the
most work, was always the last of the group to spring to the
life-line and always the first to loose the life-line and slosh
knee-deep or waist-deep through the churning water to attack the
immense and depressing tangle of rope and tackle.</p>
<p>I remarked to Mr. Pike that the men seemed thinner and weaker
than when they came on board, and he delayed replying for a
moment while he stared down at them with that
cattle-buyer&rsquo;s eye of his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure they are,&rdquo; he said disgustedly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A weak breed, that&rsquo;s what they are&mdash;nothing to
build on, no stamina.&nbsp; The least thing drags them
down.&nbsp; Why, in my day we grew fat on work like
that&mdash;only we didn&rsquo;t; we worked so hard there
wasn&rsquo;t any chance for fat.&nbsp; We kept in fighting trim,
that was all.&nbsp; But as for this scum and slum&mdash;say, you
remember, Mr. Pathurst, that man I spoke to the first day, who
said his name was Charles Davis?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one you thought there was something the matter
with?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and there was, too.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s in that
&rsquo;midship room with the Greek now.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll never
do a tap of work the whole Voyage.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a hospital
case, if there ever was one.&nbsp; Talk about shot to
pieces!&nbsp; He&rsquo;s got holes in him I could shove my fist
through.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know whether they&rsquo;re
perforating ulcers, or cancers, or cannon-shot wounds, or what
not.&nbsp; And he had the nerve to tell me they showed up after
he came on board!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he had them all the time?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the time!&nbsp; Take my word, Mr. Pathurst,
they&rsquo;re years old.&nbsp; But he&rsquo;s a wonder.&nbsp; I
watched him those first days, sent him aloft, had him down in the
fore-hold trimming a few tons of coal, did everything to him, and
he never showed a wince.&nbsp; Being up to the neck in the salt
water finally fetched him, and now he&rsquo;s reported off
duty&mdash;for the voyage.&nbsp; And he&rsquo;ll draw his wages
for the whole time, have all night in, and never do a tap.&nbsp;
Oh, he&rsquo;s a hot one to have passed over on us, and the
<i>Elsinore&rsquo;s</i> another man short.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another!&rdquo; I exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is the Greek
going to die?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No fear.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll have him steering in a few
days.&nbsp; I refer to the misfits.&nbsp; If we rolled a dozen of
them together they wouldn&rsquo;t make one real man.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m not saying it to alarm you, for there&rsquo;s nothing
alarming about it; but we&rsquo;re going to have proper hell this
voyage.&rdquo;&nbsp; He broke off to stare reflectively at his
broken knuckles, as if estimating how much drive was left in
them, then sighed and concluded, &ldquo;Well, I can see
I&rsquo;ve got my work cut out for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sympathizing with Mr. Pike is futile; the only effect is to
make his mood blacker.&nbsp; I tried it, and he retaliated
with:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You oughta see the bloke with curvature of the spine in
Mr. Mellaire&rsquo;s watch.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a proper hobo, too,
and a land lubber, and don&rsquo;t weigh more&rsquo;n a hundred
pounds, and must be fifty years old, and he&rsquo;s got curvature
of the spine, and he&rsquo;s able seaman, if you please, on the
<i>Elsinore</i>.&nbsp; And worse than all that, he puts it over
on you; he&rsquo;s nasty, he&rsquo;s mean, he&rsquo;s a viper, a
wasp.&nbsp; He ain&rsquo;t afraid of anything because he knows
you dassent hit him for fear of croaking him.&nbsp; Oh,
he&rsquo;s a pearl of purest ray serene, if anybody should slide
down a backstay and ask you.&nbsp; If you fail to identify him
any other way, his name is Mulligan Jacobs.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>After breakfast, again on deck, in Mr. Mellaire&rsquo;s watch,
I discovered another efficient.&nbsp; He was at the wheel, a
small, well-knit, muscular man of say forty-five, with black hair
graying on the temples, a big eagle-face, swarthy, with keen,
intelligent black eyes.</p>
<p>Mr. Mellaire vindicated my judgment by telling me the man was
the best sailor in his watch, a proper seaman.&nbsp; When he
referred to the man as the Maltese Cockney, and I asked why, he
replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, because he is Maltese, Mr. Pathurst; and next,
because he talks Cockney like a native.&nbsp; And depend upon it,
he heard Bow Bells before he lisped his first word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And has O&rsquo;Sullivan bought Andy Fay&rsquo;s
sea-boots yet?&rdquo; I queried.</p>
<p>It was at this moment that Miss West emerged upon the
poop.&nbsp; She was as rosy and vital as ever, and certainly, if
she had been sea-sick, she flew no signals of it.&nbsp; As she
came toward me, greeting me, I could not help remarking again the
lithe and springy limb-movement with which she walked, and her
fine, firm skin.&nbsp; Her neck, free in a sailor collar, with
white sweater open at the throat, seemed almost redoubtably
strong to my sleepless, jaundiced eyes.&nbsp; Her hair, under a
white knitted cap, was smooth and well-groomed.&nbsp; In fact,
the totality of impression she conveyed was of a well-groomedness
one would not expect of a sea-captain&rsquo;s daughter, much less
of a woman who had been sea-sick.&nbsp; Life!&mdash;that is the
key of her, the essential note of her&mdash;life and
health.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll wager she has never entertained a morbid
thought in that practical, balanced, sensible head of hers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how have you been?&rdquo; she asked, then rattled
on with sheer exuberance ere I could answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Had a
lovely night&rsquo;s sleep.&nbsp; I was really over my sickness
yesterday, but I just devoted myself to resting up.&nbsp; I slept
ten solid hours&mdash;what do you think of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could say the same,&rdquo; I replied with
appropriate dejection, as I swung in beside her, for she had
evinced her intention of promenading.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, then you&rsquo;ve been sick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; I answered dryly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And I wish I had been.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t had five
hours&rsquo; sleep all told since I came on board.&nbsp; These
pestiferous hives. . . &rdquo;</p>
<p>I held up a lumpy wrist to show.&nbsp; She took one glance at
it, halted abruptly, and, neatly balancing herself to the roll,
took my wrist in both her hands and gave it close scrutiny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy!&rdquo; she cried; and then began to laugh.</p>
<p>I was of two minds.&nbsp; Her laughter was delightful to the
ear, there was such a mellowness, and healthiness, and frankness
about it.&nbsp; On the other hand, that it should be directed at
my misfortune was exasperating.&nbsp; I suppose my perplexity
showed in my face, for when she had eased her laughter and looked
at me with a sobering countenance, she immediately went off into
more peals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You poor child,&rdquo; she gurgled at last.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And when I think of all the cream of tartar I made you
consume!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was rather presumptuous of her to poor-child me, and I
resolved to take advantage of the data I already possessed in
order to ascertain just how many years she was my junior.&nbsp;
She had told me she was twelve years old the time the
<i>Dixie</i> collided with the river steamer in San Francisco
Bay.&nbsp; Very well, all I had to do was to ascertain the date
of that disaster and I had her.&nbsp; But in the meantime she
laughed at me and my hives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it is&mdash;er&mdash;humorous, in some sort
of way,&rdquo; I said a bit stiffly, only to find that there was
no use in being stiff with Miss West, for it only set her off
into more laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you needed,&rdquo; she announced, with fresh
gurglings, &ldquo;was an exterior treatment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me I&rsquo;ve got the chicken-pox or
the measles,&rdquo; I protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;&nbsp; She shook her head emphatically while
she enjoyed another paroxysm.&nbsp; &ldquo;What you are suffering
from is a severe attack . . . &rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused deliberately, and looked me straight the eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of bedbugs,&rdquo; she concluded.&nbsp; And then, all
seriousness and practicality, she went on: &ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll
have that righted in a jiffy.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll turn the
<i>Elsinore&rsquo;s</i> after-quarters upside down, though I know
there are none in father&rsquo;s room or mine.&nbsp; And though
this is my first voyage with Mr. Pike I know he&rsquo;s too
hard-bitten&rdquo; (here I laughed at her involuntary pun)
&ldquo;an old sailor not to know that his room is clean.&nbsp;
Yours&rdquo; (I was perturbed for fear she was going to say that
I had brought them on board) &ldquo;have most probably drifted in
from for&rsquo;ard.&nbsp; They always have them
for&rsquo;ard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, Mr. Pathurst, I am going down to attend to
your case.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d better get your Wada to make up a
camping kit for you.&nbsp; The next couple of nights you&rsquo;ll
spend in the cabin or chart-room.&nbsp; And be sure Wada removes
all silver and metallic tarnishable stuff from your rooms.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s going to be all sorts of fumigating, and tearing
out of woodwork, and rebuilding.&nbsp; Trust me.&nbsp; I know the
vermin.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<p>Such a cleaning up and turning over!&nbsp; For two nights, one
in the chart-room and one on the cabin sofa, I have soaked myself
in sleep, and I am now almost stupid with excess of sleep.&nbsp;
The land seems very far away.&nbsp; By some strange quirk, I have
an impression that weeks, or months, have passed since I left
Baltimore on that bitter March morning.&nbsp; And yet it was
March 28, and this is only the first week in April.</p>
<p>I was entirely right in my first estimation of Miss
West.&nbsp; She is the most capable, practically masterful woman
I have ever encountered.&nbsp; What passed between her and Mr.
Pike I do not know; but whatever it was, she was convinced that
he was not the erring one.&nbsp; In some strange way, my two
rooms are the only ones which have been invaded by this plague of
vermin.&nbsp; Under Miss West&rsquo;s instructions bunks,
drawers, shelves, and all superficial woodwork have been ripped
out.&nbsp; She worked the carpenter from daylight till dark, and
then, after a night of fumigation, two of the sailors, with
turpentine and white lead, put the finishing touches on the
cleansing operations.&nbsp; The carpenter is now busy rebuilding
my rooms.&nbsp; Then will come the painting, and in two or three
more days I expect to be settled back in my quarters.</p>
<p>Of the men who did the turpentining and white-leading there
have been four.&nbsp; Two of them were quickly rejected by Miss
West as not being up to the work.&nbsp; The first one, Steve
Roberts, which he told me was his name, is an interesting
fellow.&nbsp; I talked with him quite a bit ere Miss West sent
him packing and told Mr. Pike that she wanted a real sailor.</p>
<p>This is the first time Steve Roberts has ever seen the
sea.&nbsp; How he happened to drift from the western
cattle-ranges to New York he did not explain, any more than did
he explain how he came to ship on the <i>Elsinore</i>.&nbsp; But
here he is, not a sailor on horseback, but a cowboy on the
sea.&nbsp; He is a small man, but most powerfully built.&nbsp;
His shoulders are very broad, and his muscles bulge under his
shirt; and yet he is slender-waisted, lean-limbed, and
hollow-cheeked.&nbsp; This last, however, is not due to sickness
or ill-health.&nbsp; Tyro as he is on the sea, Steve Roberts is
keen and intelligent . . . yes, and crooked.&nbsp; He has a way
of looking straight at one with utmost frankness while he talks,
and yet it is at such moments I get most strongly the impression
of crookedness.&nbsp; But he is a man, if trouble should arise,
to be reckoned with.&nbsp; In ways he suggests a kinship with the
three men Mr. Pike took so instant a prejudice against&mdash;Kid
Twist, Nosey Murphy, and Bert Rhine.&nbsp; And I have already
noticed, in the dog-watches, that it is with this trio that Steve
Roberts chums.</p>
<p>The second sailor Miss West rejected, after silently watching
him work for five minutes, was Mulligan Jacobs, the wisp of a man
with curvature of the spine.&nbsp; But before she sent him
packing other things occurred in which I was concerned.&nbsp; I
was in the room when Mulligan Jacobs first came in to go to work,
and I could not help observing the startled, avid glance he threw
at my big shelves of books.&nbsp; He advanced on them in the way
a robber might advance on a secret hoard of gold, and as a miser
would fondle gold so Mulligan Jacobs fondled these book-titles
with his eyes.</p>
<p>And such eyes!&nbsp; All time bitterness and venom Mr. Pike
had told me the man possessed was there in his eyes.&nbsp; They
were small, pale-blue, and gimlet-pointed with fire.&nbsp; His
eyelids were inflamed, and but served to ensanguine the bitter
and cold-blazing intensity of the pupils.&nbsp; The man was
constitutionally a hater, and I was not long in learning that he
hated all things except books.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you care to read some of them?&rdquo; I said
hospitably.</p>
<p>All the caress in his eyes for the books vanished as he turned
his head to look at me, and ere he spoke I knew that I, too, was
hated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hell, ain&rsquo;t it?&mdash;you with a
strong body and servants to carry for you a weight of books like
this, and me with a curved spine that puts the pot-hooks of
hell-fire into my brain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>How can I possibly convey the terrible venomousness with which
he uttered these words?&nbsp; I know that Mr. Pike, dragging his
feet down the hall past my open door, gave me a very gratifying
sense of safety.&nbsp; Being alone in the room with this man
seemed much the same as if I were locked in a cage with a
tiger-cat.&nbsp; The devilishness, the wickedness, and, above
all, the pitch of glaring hatred with which the man eyed me and
addressed me, were most unpleasant.&nbsp; I swear I knew
fear&mdash;not calculated caution, not timid apprehension, but
blind, panic, unreasoned terror.&nbsp; The malignancy of the
creature was blood curdling; nor did it require words to convey
it: it poured from him, out of his red-rimmed, blazing eyes, out
of his withered, twisted, tortured face, out of his
broken-nailed, crooked talons of hands.&nbsp; And yet, in that
very moment of instinctive startle and repulsion, the thought was
in my mind that with one hand I could take the throat of the
weazened wisp of a crippled thing and throttle the malformed life
out of it.</p>
<p>But there was little encouragement in such thought&mdash;no
more than a man might feel in a cave of rattlesnakes or a pit of
centipedes, for, crush them with his very bulk, nevertheless they
would first sink their poison into him.&nbsp; And so with this
Mulligan Jacobs.&nbsp; My fear of him was the fear of being
infected with his venom.&nbsp; I could not help it; for I caught
a quick vision of the black and broken teeth I had seen in his
mouth sinking into my flesh, polluting me, eating me with their
acid, destroying me.</p>
<p>One thing was very clear.&nbsp; In the creature was no
fear.&nbsp; Absolutely, he did not know fear.&nbsp; He was as
devoid of it as the fetid slime one treads underfoot in
nightmares.&nbsp; Lord, Lord! that is what the thing was, a
nightmare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You suffer pain often?&rdquo; I asked, attempting to
get myself in hand by the calculated use of sympathy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hooks are in me, in the brain, white-hot hooks that
burn an&rsquo; burn,&rdquo; was his reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;But by
what damnable right do you have all these books, and time to read
&rsquo;em, an&rsquo; all night in to read &rsquo;em, an&rsquo;
soak in them, when me brain&rsquo;s on fire, and I&rsquo;m watch
and watch, an&rsquo; me broken spine won&rsquo;t let me carry
half a hundredweight of books about with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another madman, was my conclusion; and yet I was quickly
compelled to modify it, for, thinking to play with a
rattle-brain, I asked him what were the books up to half a
hundredweight he carried, and what were the writers he
preferred.&nbsp; His library, he told me, among other things
included, first and fore-most, a complete Byron.&nbsp; Next was a
complete Shakespeare; also a complete Browning in one
volume.&nbsp; A full hall-dozen he had in the forecastle of
Renan, a stray volume of Lecky, Winwood Reade&rsquo;s
<i>Martyrdom of Man</i>, several of Carlyle, and eight or ten of
Zola.&nbsp; Zola he swore by, though Anatole France was a prime
favourite.</p>
<p>He might be mad, was my revised judgment, but he was most
differently mad from any madman I had ever encountered.&nbsp; I
talked on with him about books and bookmen.&nbsp; He was most
universal and particular.&nbsp; He liked O.&nbsp; Henry.&nbsp;
George Moore was a cad and a four&mdash;flusher.&nbsp; Edgar
Saltus&rsquo; <i>Anatomy of Negation</i> was profounder than
Kant.&nbsp; Maeterlinck was a mystic frump.&nbsp; Emerson was a
charlatan.&nbsp; Ibsen&rsquo;s <i>Ghosts</i> was the stuff,
though Ibsen was a bourgeois lickspittler.&nbsp; Heine was the
real goods.&nbsp; He preferred Flaubert to de Maupassant, and
Turgenieff to Tolstoy; but Gorky was the best of the Russian
boiling.&nbsp; John Masefield knew what he was writing about, and
Joseph Conrad was living too fat to turn out the stuff he first
turned out.</p>
<p>And so it went, the most amazing running commentary on
literature I had ever heard.&nbsp; I was hugely interested, and I
quizzed him on sociology.&nbsp; Yes, he was a Red, and knew his
Kropotkin, but he was no anarchist.&nbsp; On the other hand,
political action was a blind-alley leading to reformism and
quietism.&nbsp; Political socialism had gone to pot, while
industrial unionism was the logical culmination of Marxism.&nbsp;
He was a direct actionist.&nbsp; The mass strike was the
thing.&nbsp; Sabotage, not merely as a withdrawal of efficiency,
but as a keen destruction-of-profits policy, was the
weapon.&nbsp; Of course he believed in the propaganda of the
deed, but a man was a fool to talk about it.&nbsp; His job was to
do it and keep his mouth shut, and the way to do it was to shoot
the evidence.&nbsp; Of course, <i>he</i> talked; but what of
it?&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t he have curvature of the spine?&nbsp; He
didn&rsquo;t care when he got his, and woe to the man who tried
to give it to him.</p>
<p>And while he talked he hated me.&nbsp; He seemed to hate the
things he talked about and espoused.&nbsp; I judged him to be of
Irish descent, and it was patent that he was self-educated.&nbsp;
When I asked him how it was he had come to sea, he replied that
the hooks in his brain were as hot one place as another.&nbsp; He
unbent enough to tell me that he had been an athlete, when he was
a young man, a professional foot-racer in Eastern Canada.&nbsp;
And then his disease had come upon him, and for a quarter of a
century he had been a common tramp and vagabond, and he bragged
of a personal acquaintance with more city prisons and county
jails than any man that ever existed.</p>
<p>It was at this stage in our talk that Mr. Pike thrust his head
into the doorway.&nbsp; He did not address me, but he favoured me
with a most sour look of disapprobation.&nbsp; Mr. Pike&rsquo;s
countenance is almost petrified.&nbsp; Any expression seems to
crack it&mdash;with the exception of sourness.&nbsp; But when Mr.
Pike wants to look sour he has no difficulty at all.&nbsp; His
hard-skinned, hard-muscled face just flows to sourness.&nbsp;
Evidently he condemned my consuming Mulligan Jacobs&rsquo;s
time.&nbsp; To Mulligan Jacobs he said in his customary
snarl:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on an&rsquo; get to your work.&nbsp; Chew the rag in
your watch below.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then I got a sample of Mulligan Jacobs.&nbsp; The venom of
hatred I had already seen in his face was as nothing compared
with what now was manifested.&nbsp; I had a feeling that, like
stroking a cat in cold weather, did I touch his face it would
crackle electric sparks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, go to hell, you old stiff,&rdquo; said Mulligan
Jacobs.</p>
<p>If ever I had seen murder in a man&rsquo;s eyes, I saw it then
in the mate&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He lunged into the room, his arm
tensed to strike, the hand not open but clenched.&nbsp; One
stroke of that bear&rsquo;s paw and Mulligan Jacobs and all the
poisonous flame of him would have been quenched in the
everlasting darkness.&nbsp; But he was unafraid.&nbsp; Like a
cornered rat, like a rattlesnake on the trail, unflinching,
sneering, snarling, he faced the irate giant.&nbsp; More than
that.&nbsp; He even thrust his face forward on its twisted neck
to meet the blow.</p>
<p>It was too much for Mr. Pike; it was too impossible to strike
that frail, crippled, repulsive thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me that can call you the stiff,&rdquo; said
Mulligan Jacobs.&nbsp; &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t no Larry.&nbsp;
G&rsquo;wan an&rsquo; hit me.&nbsp; Why don&rsquo;t you hit
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Mr. Pike was too appalled to strike the creature.&nbsp;
He, whose whole career on the sea had been that of a bucko driver
in a shambles, could not strike this fractured splinter of a
man.&nbsp; I swear that Mr. Pike actually struggled with himself
to strike.&nbsp; I saw it.&nbsp; But he could not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on to your work,&rdquo; he ordered.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
voyage is young yet, Mulligan.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll have you
eatin&rsquo; outa my hand before it&rsquo;s over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Mulligan Jacobs&rsquo;s face thrust another inch closer on
its twisted neck, while all his concentrated rage seemed on the
verge of bursting into incandescence.&nbsp; So immense and
tremendous was the bitterness that consumed him that he could
find no words to clothe it.&nbsp; All he could do was to hawk and
guttural deep in his throat until I should not have been
surprised had he spat poison in the mate&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>And Mr. Pike turned on his heel and left the room, beaten,
absolutely beaten.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t get it out of my mind.&nbsp; The picture of the
mate and the cripple facing each other keeps leaping up under my
eyelids.&nbsp; This is different from the books and from what I
know of existence.&nbsp; It is revelation.&nbsp; Life is a
profoundly amazing thing.&nbsp; What is this bitter flame that
informs Mulligan Jacobs?&nbsp; How dare he&mdash;with no hope of
any profit, not a hero, not a leader of a forlorn hope nor a
martyr to God, but a mere filthy, malignant rat&mdash;how dare
he, I ask myself, be so defiant, so death-inviting?&nbsp; The
spectacle of him makes me doubt all the schools of the
metaphysicians and the realists.&nbsp; No philosophy has a leg to
stand on that does not account for Mulligan Jacobs.&nbsp; And all
the midnight oil of philosophy I have burned does not enable me
to account for Mulligan Jacobs . . . unless he be insane.&nbsp;
And then I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Was there ever such a freight of human souls on the sea as
these humans with whom I am herded on the <i>Elsinore</i>?</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>And now, working in my rooms, white-leading and turpentining,
is another one of them.&nbsp; I have learned his name.&nbsp; It
is Arthur Deacon.&nbsp; He is the pallid, furtive-eyed man whom I
observed the first day when the men were routed out of the
forecastle to man the windlass&mdash;the man I so instantly
adjudged a drug-fiend.&nbsp; He certainly looks it.</p>
<p>I asked Mr. Pike his estimate of the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;White slaver,&rdquo; was his answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Had
to skin outa New York to save his skin.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll be
consorting with those other three larrakins I gave a piece of my
mind to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what do you make of them?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A month&rsquo;s wages to a pound of tobacco that a
district attorney, or a committee of some sort investigating the
New York police is lookin&rsquo; for &rsquo;em right now.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;d like to have the cash somebody&rsquo;s put up in New
York to send them on this get-away.&nbsp; Oh, I know the
breed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gangsters?&rdquo; I queried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ll trim their
dirty hides.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll trim &rsquo;em.&nbsp; Mr. Pathurst,
this voyage ain&rsquo;t started yet, and this old stiff&rsquo;s a
long way from his last legs.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll give them a run for
their money.&nbsp; Why, I&rsquo;ve buried better men than the
best of them aboard this craft.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;ll bury some of
them that think me an old stiff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused and looked at me solemnly for a full half
minute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Pathurst, I&rsquo;ve heard you&rsquo;re a writing
man.&nbsp; And when they told me at the agents&rsquo; you were
going along passenger, I made a point of going to see your
play.&nbsp; Now I&rsquo;m not saying anything about that play,
one way or the other.&nbsp; But I just want to tell you, that as
a writing man you&rsquo;ll get stuff in plenty to write about on
this voyage.&nbsp; Hell&rsquo;s going to pop, believe me, and
right here before you is the stiff that&rsquo;ll do a lot of the
poppin&rsquo;.&nbsp; Some several and plenty&rsquo;s going to
learn who&rsquo;s an old stiff.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<p>How I have been sleeping!&nbsp; This relief of renewed
normality is delicious&mdash;thanks to Miss West.&nbsp; Now why
did not Captain West, or Mr. Pike, both experienced men, diagnose
my trouble for me?&nbsp; And then there was Wada.&nbsp; But no;
it required Miss West.&nbsp; Again I contemplate the problem of
woman.&nbsp; It is just such an incident among a million others
that keeps the thinker&rsquo;s gaze fixed on woman.&nbsp; They
truly are the mothers and the conservers of the race.</p>
<p>Rail as I will at Miss West&rsquo;s red-blood complacency of
life, yet I must bow my head to her life-giving to me.&nbsp;
Practical, sensible, hard-headed, a comfort-maker and a
nest-builder, possessing all the distressing attributes of the
blind-instinctive race-mother, nevertheless I must confess I am
most grateful that she is along.&nbsp; Had she not been on the
<i>Elsinore</i>, by this time I should have been so overwrought
from lack of sleep that I would be biting my veins and
howling&mdash;as mad a hatter as any of our cargo of mad
hatters.&nbsp; And so we come to it&mdash;the everlasting mystery
of woman.&nbsp; One may not be able to get along with her; yet is
it patent, as of old time, that one cannot get along without
her.&nbsp; But, regarding Miss West, I do entertain one fervent
hope, namely, that she is not a suffragette.&nbsp; That would be
too much.</p>
<p>Captain West may be a Samurai, but he is also human.&nbsp; He
was really a bit fluttery this morning, in his reserved,
controlled way, when he regretted the plague of vermin I had
encountered in my rooms.&nbsp; It seems he has a keen sense of
hospitality, and that he is my host on the <i>Elsinore</i>, and
that, although he is oblivious of the existence of the crew, he
is not oblivious of my comfort.&nbsp; By his few expressions of
regret it appears that he cannot forgive himself for his careless
acceptance of the erroneous diagnosis of my affliction.&nbsp;
Yes; Captain West is a real human man.&nbsp; Is he not the father
of the slender-faced, strapping-bodied Miss West?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank goodness that&rsquo;s settled,&rdquo; was Miss
West&rsquo;s exclamation this morning, when we met on the poop
and after I had told her how gloriously I had slept.</p>
<p>And then, that nightmare episode dismissed because, forsooth,
for all practical purposes&mdash;it was settled, she next
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on and see the chickens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I accompanied her along the spidery bridge to the top of
the &rsquo;midship-house, to look at the one rooster and the four
dozen fat hens in the ship&rsquo;s chicken-coop.</p>
<p>As I accompanied her, my eyes dwelling pleasurably on that
vital gait of hers as she preceded me, I could not help
reflecting that, coming down on the tug from Baltimore, she had
promised not to bother me nor require to be entertained.</p>
<p><i>Come and see the chickens</i>!&mdash;Oh, the sheer female
possessiveness of that simple invitation!&nbsp; For effrontery of
possessiveness is there anything that can exceed the nest-making,
planet-populating, female, human woman?&mdash;<i>Come and see the
chickens</i>!&nbsp; Oh, well, the sailors for&rsquo;ard may be
hard-bitten, but I can promise Miss West that here, aft, is one
male passenger, unmarried and never married, who is an equally
hard-bitten adventurer on the sea of matrimony.&nbsp; When I go
over the census I remember at least several women, superior to
Miss West, who trilled their song of sex and failed to shipwreck
me.</p>
<p>As I read over what I have written I notice how the
terminology of the sea has stolen into my mental processes.&nbsp;
Involuntarily I think in terms of the sea.&nbsp; Another thing I
notice is my excessive use of superlatives.&nbsp; But then,
everything on board the <i>Elsinore</i> is superlative.&nbsp; I
find myself continually combing my vocabulary in quest of just
and adequate words.&nbsp; Yet am I aware of failure.&nbsp; For
example, all the words of all the dictionaries would fail to
approximate the exceeding terribleness of Mulligan Jacobs.</p>
<p>But to return to the chickens.&nbsp; Despite every precaution,
it was evident that they had had a hard time during the past days
of storm.&nbsp; It was equally evident that Miss West, even
during her sea-sickness, had not neglected them.&nbsp; Under her
directions the steward had actually installed a small oil-stove
in the big coop, and she now beckoned him up to the top of the
house as he was passing for&rsquo;ard to the galley.&nbsp; It was
for the purpose of instructing him further in the matter of
feeding them.</p>
<p>Where were the grits?&nbsp; They needed grits.&nbsp; He
didn&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; The sack had been lost among the
miscellaneous stores, but Mr. Pike had promised a couple of
sailors that afternoon to overhaul the lazarette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty of ashes,&rdquo; she told the steward.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Remember.&nbsp; And if a sailor doesn&rsquo;t clean the
coop each day, you report to me.&nbsp; And give them only clean
food&mdash;no spoiled scraps, mind.&nbsp; How many eggs
yesterday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The steward&rsquo;s eyes glistened with enthusiasm as he said
he had got nine the day before and expected fully a dozen
to-day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The poor things,&rdquo; said Miss West&mdash;to
me.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve no idea how bad weather reduces
their laying.&rdquo;&nbsp; She turned back upon the
steward.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mind now, you watch and find out which hens
don&rsquo;t lay, and kill them first.&nbsp; And you ask me each
time before you kill one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I found myself neglected, out there on top the draughty house,
while Miss West talked chickens with the Chinese
ex-smuggler.&nbsp; But it gave me opportunity to observe
her.&nbsp; It is the length of her eyes that accentuates their
steadiness of gaze&mdash;helped, of course, by the dark brows and
lashes.&nbsp; I noted again the warm gray of her eyes.&nbsp; And
I began to identify her, to locate her.&nbsp; She is a physical
type of the best of the womanhood of old New England.&nbsp;
Nothing spare nor meagre, nor bred out, but generously strong,
and yet not quite what one would call robust.&nbsp; When I said
she was strapping-bodied I erred.&nbsp; I must fall back on my
other word, which will have to be the last: Miss West is
vital-bodied.&nbsp; That is the key-word.</p>
<p>When we had regained the poop, and Miss West had gone below, I
ventured my customary pleasantry with Mr. Mellaire of:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And has O&rsquo;Sullivan bought Andy Fay&rsquo;s
sea-boots yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet, Mr. Pathurst,&rdquo; was the reply,
&ldquo;though he nearly got them early this morning.&nbsp; Come
on along, sir, and I&rsquo;ll show you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vouchsafing no further information, the second mate led the
way along the bridge, across the &rsquo;midship-house and the
for&rsquo;ard-house.&nbsp; From the edge of the latter, looking
down on Number One hatch, I saw two Japanese, with sail-needles
and twine, sewing up a canvas-swathed bundle that unmistakably
contained a human body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O&rsquo;Sullivan used a razor,&rdquo; said Mr.
Mellaire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that is Andy Fay?&rdquo; I cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, not Andy.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s a Dutchman.&nbsp;
Christian Jespersen was his name on the articles.&nbsp; He got in
O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s way when O&rsquo;Sullivan went after the
boots.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what saved Andy.&nbsp; Andy was more
active.&nbsp; Jespersen couldn&rsquo;t get out of his own way,
much less out of O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
Andy sitting over there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I followed Mr. Mellaire&rsquo;s gaze, and saw the burnt-out,
aged little Scotchman squatted on a spare spar and sucking a
pipe.&nbsp; One arm was in a sling and his head was
bandaged.&nbsp; Beside him squatted Mulligan Jacobs.&nbsp; They
were a pair.&nbsp; Both were blue-eyed, and both were
malevolent-eyed.&nbsp; And they were equally emaciated.&nbsp; It
was easy to see that they had discovered early in the voyage
their kinship of bitterness.&nbsp; Andy Fay, I knew, was
sixty-three years old, although he looked a hundred; and Mulligan
Jacobs, who was only about fifty, made up for the difference by
the furnace-heat of hatred that burned in his face and
eyes.&nbsp; I wondered if he sat beside the injured bitter one in
some sense of sympathy, or if he were there in order to
gloat.</p>
<p>Around the corner of the house strolled Shorty, flinging up to
me his inevitable clown-grin.&nbsp; One hand was swathed in
bandages.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must have kept Mr. Pike busy,&rdquo; was my comment to
Mr. Mellaire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was sewing up cripples about all his watch from four
till eight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; I asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are there any
more?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One more, sir, a sheeny.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t know his
name before, but Mr. Pike got it&mdash;Isaac B. Chantz.&nbsp; I
never saw in all my life at sea as many sheenies as are on board
the <i>Elsinore</i> right now.&nbsp; Sheenies don&rsquo;t take to
the sea as a rule.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve certainly got more than our
share of them.&nbsp; Chantz isn&rsquo;t badly hurt, but you ought
to hear him whimper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s O&rsquo;Sullivan?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the &rsquo;midship-house with Davis, and without a
mark.&nbsp; Mr. Pike got into the rumpus and put him to sleep
with one on the jaw.&nbsp; And now he&rsquo;s lashed down and
talking in a trance.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s thrown the fear of God into
Davis.&nbsp; Davis is sitting up in his bunk with a marlin-spike,
threatening to brain O&rsquo;Sullivan if he starts to break
loose, and complaining that it&rsquo;s no way to run a
hospital.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d have padded cells, straitjackets,
night and day nurses, and violent wards, I suppose&mdash;and a
convalescents&rsquo; home in a Queen Anne cottage on the
poop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear, oh dear,&rdquo; Mr. Mellaire sighed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This is the funniest voyage and the funniest crew
I&rsquo;ve ever tackled.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not going to come to a
good end.&nbsp; Anybody can see that with half an eye.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;ll be dead of winter off the Horn, and a
fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;s&rsquo;le full of lunatics and cripples to do
the work.&mdash;Just take a look at that one.&nbsp; Crazy as a
bedbug.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s likely to go overboard any
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I followed his glance and saw Tony the Greek, the one who had
sprung overboard the first day.&nbsp; He had just come around the
corner of the house, and, beyond one arm in a sling, seemed in
good condition.&nbsp; He walked easily and with strength, a
testimonial to the virtues of Mr. Pike&rsquo;s rough surgery.</p>
<p>My eyes kept returning to the canvas-covered body of Christian
Jespersen, and to the Japanese who sewed with sail-twine his
sailor&rsquo;s shroud.&nbsp; One of them had his right hand in a
huge wrapping of cotton and bandage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he get hurt, too?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s the sail-maker.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;re both sail-makers.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a good one,
too.&nbsp; Yatsuda is his name.&nbsp; But he&rsquo;s just had
blood-poisoning and lain in hospital in New York for eighteen
months.&nbsp; He flatly refused to let them amputate.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s all right now, but the hand is dead, all except the
thumb and fore-finger, and he&rsquo;s teaching himself to sew
with his left hand.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s as clever a sail-maker as
you&rsquo;ll find at sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lunatic and a razor make a cruel combination,&rdquo;
I remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s put five men out of commission,&rdquo; Mr.
Mellaire sighed.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s O&rsquo;Sullivan
himself, and Christian Jespersen gone, and Andy Fay, and Shorty,
and the sheeny.&nbsp; And the voyage not started yet.&nbsp; And
there&rsquo;s Lars with the broken leg, and Davis laid off for
keeps&mdash;why, sir, we&rsquo;ll soon be that weak it&rsquo;ll
take both watches to set a staysail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, while I talked in a matter-of-fact way with Mr.
Mellaire, I was shocked&mdash;no; not because death was aboard
with us.&nbsp; I have stood by my philosophic guns too long to be
shocked by death, or by murder.&nbsp; What affected me was the
utter, stupid bestiality of the affair.&nbsp; Even
murder&mdash;murder for cause&mdash;I can understand.&nbsp; It is
comprehensible that men should kill one another in the passion of
love, of hatred, of patriotism, of religion.&nbsp; But this was
different.&nbsp; Here was killing without cause, an orgy of
blind-brutishness, a thing monstrously irrational.</p>
<p>Later on, strolling with Possum on the main deck, as I passed
the open door of the hospital I heard the muttering chant of
O&rsquo;Sullivan, and peeped in.&nbsp; There he lay, lashed fast
on his back in the lower bunk, rolling his eyes and raving.&nbsp;
In the top bunk, directly above, lay Charles Davis, calmly
smoking a pipe.&nbsp; I looked for the marlin-spike.&nbsp; There
it was, ready to hand, on the bedding beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hell, ain&rsquo;t it, sir?&rdquo; was his
greeting.&nbsp; &ldquo;And how am I goin&rsquo; to get any sleep
with that baboon chattering away there.&nbsp; He never lets
up&mdash;keeps his chin-music goin&rsquo; right along when
he&rsquo;s asleep, only worse.&nbsp; The way he grits his teeth
is something awful.&nbsp; Now I leave it to you, sir, is it right
to put a crazy like that in with a sick man?&nbsp; And I am a
sick man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While he talked the massive form of Mr. Pike loomed beside me
and halted just out of sight of the man in the bunk.&nbsp; And
the man talked on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By rights, I oughta have that lower bunk.&nbsp; It
hurts me to crawl up here.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s inhumanity,
that&rsquo;s what it is, and sailors at sea are better protected
by the law than they used to be.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;ll have you
for a witness to this before the court when we get to
Seattle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Pike stepped into the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up, you damned sea-lawyer, you,&rdquo; he
snarled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you played a dirty trick
enough comin&rsquo; on board this ship in your condition?&nbsp;
And if I have anything more out of you . . . &rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Pike was so angry that he could not complete the
threat.&nbsp; After spluttering for a moment he made a fresh
attempt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You . . . you . . . well, you annoy me, that&rsquo;s
what you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know the law, sir,&rdquo; Davis answered
promptly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I worked full able seaman on this here
ship.&nbsp; All hands can testify to that.&nbsp; I was aloft from
the start.&nbsp; Yes, sir, and up to my neck in salt water day
and night.&nbsp; And you had me below trimmin&rsquo; coal.&nbsp;
I did full duty and more, until this sickness got
me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were petrified and rotten before you ever saw this
ship,&rdquo; Mr. Pike broke in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The court&rsquo;ll decide that, sir,&rdquo; replied the
imperturbable Davis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if you go to shoutin&rsquo; off your sea-lawyer
mouth,&rdquo; Mr. Pike continued, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll jerk you out
of that and show you what real work is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; lay the owners open for lovely damages when
we get in,&rdquo; Davis sneered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if I bury you before we get in,&rdquo; was the
mate&rsquo;s quick, grim retort.&nbsp; &ldquo;And let me tell
you, Davis, you ain&rsquo;t the first sea-lawyer I&rsquo;ve
dropped over the side with a sack of coal to his feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Pike turned, with a final &ldquo;Damned sea-lawyer!&rdquo;
and started along the deck.&nbsp; I was walking behind him when
he stopped abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Pathurst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not as an officer to a passenger did he thus address me.&nbsp;
His tone was imperative, and I gave heed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Pathurst.&nbsp; From now on the less you see aboard
this ship the better.&nbsp; That is all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And again he turned on his heel and went his way.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<p>No, the sea is not a gentle place.&nbsp; It must be the very
hardness of the life that makes all sea-people hard.&nbsp; Of
course, Captain West is unaware that his crew exists, and Mr.
Pike and Mr. Mellaire never address the men save to give
commands.&nbsp; But Miss West, who is more like myself, a
passenger, ignores the men.&nbsp; She does not even say
good-morning to the man at the wheel when she first comes on
deck.&nbsp; Nevertheless I shall, at least to the man at the
wheel.&nbsp; Am I not a passenger?</p>
<p>Which reminds me.&nbsp; Technically I am not a
passenger.&nbsp; The <i>Elsinore</i> has no licence to carry
passengers, and I am down on the articles as third mate and am
supposed to receive thirty-five dollars a month.&nbsp; Wada is
down as cabin boy, although I paid a good price for his passage
and he is my servant.</p>
<p>Not much time is lost at sea in getting rid of the dead.&nbsp;
Within an hour after I had watched the sail-makers at work
Christian Jespersen was slid overboard, feet first, a sack of
coal to his feet to sink him.&nbsp; It was a mild, calm day, and
the <i>Elsinore</i>, logging a lazy two knots, was not hove to
for the occasion.&nbsp; At the last moment Captain West came
for&rsquo;ard, prayer-book in hand, read the brief service for
burial at sea, and returned immediately aft.&nbsp; It was the
first time I had seen him for&rsquo;ard.</p>
<p>I shall not bother to describe the burial.&nbsp; All I shall
say of it is that it was as sordid as Christian Jespersen&rsquo;s
life had been and as his death had been.</p>
<p>As for Miss West, she sat in a deck-chair on the poop busily
engaged with some sort of fancy work.&nbsp; When Christian
Jespersen and his coal splashed into the sea the crew immediately
dispersed, the watch below going to its bunks, the watch on deck
to its work.&nbsp; Not a minute elapsed ere Mr. Mellaire was
giving orders and the men were pulling and hauling.&nbsp; So I
returned to the poop to be unpleasantly impressed by Miss
West&rsquo;s smiling unconcern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s buried,&rdquo; I observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said, with all the tonelessness of
disinterest, and went on with her stitching.</p>
<p>She must have sensed my frame of mind, for, after a moment,
she paused from her sewing and looked at me.</p>
<p>Your first sea funeral, Mr. Pathurst?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Death at sea does not seem to affect you,&rdquo; I said
bluntly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not any more than on the land.&rdquo;&nbsp; She
shrugged her shoulders.&nbsp; &ldquo;So many people die, you
know.&nbsp; And when they are strangers to you . . . well, what
do you do on the land when you learn that some workers have been
killed in a factory you pass every day coming to town?&nbsp; It
is the same on the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad we are a hand short,&rdquo; I said
deliberately.</p>
<p>It did not miss her.&nbsp; Just as deliberately she
replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, isn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; And so early in the voyage,
too.&rdquo;&nbsp; She looked at me, and when I could not forbear
a smile of appreciation she smiled back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know very well, Mr. Pathurst, that you think me a
heartless wretch.&nbsp; But it isn&rsquo;t that it&rsquo;s . . .
it&rsquo;s the sea, I suppose.&nbsp; And yet, I didn&rsquo;t know
this man.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t remember ever having seen
him.&nbsp; At this stage of the voyage I doubt if I could pick
out half-a-dozen of the sailors as men I had ever laid eyes
on.&nbsp; So why vex myself with even thinking of this stupid
stranger who was killed by another stupid stranger?&nbsp; As well
might one die of grief with reading the murder columns of the
daily papers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet, it seems somehow different,&rdquo; I
contended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll get used to it,&rdquo; she assured me
cheerfully, and returned to her sewing.</p>
<p>I asked her if she had read Moody&rsquo;s <i>Ship of
Souls</i>, but she had not.&nbsp; I searched her out
further.&nbsp; She liked Browning, and was especially fond of
<i>The Ring and the Book</i>.&nbsp; This was the key to
her.&nbsp; She cared only for healthful literature&mdash;for the
literature that exposits the vital lies of life.</p>
<p>For instance, the mention of Schopenhauer produced smiles and
laughter.&nbsp; To her all the philosophers of pessimism were
laughable.&nbsp; The red blood of her would not permit her to
take them seriously.&nbsp; I tried her out with a conversation I
had had with De Casseres shortly before leaving New York.&nbsp;
De Casseres, after tracing Jules de Gaultier&rsquo;s philosophic
genealogy back to Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, had concluded with
the proposition that out of their two formulas de Gaultier had
constructed an even profounder formula.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;Will-to-Live&rdquo; of the one and the
&ldquo;Will-to-Power&rdquo; of the other were, after all, only
parts of de Gaultier&rsquo;s supreme generalization, the
&ldquo;Will-to-Illusion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I flatter myself that even De Casseres would have been pleased
with the way I repeated his argument.&nbsp; And when I had
concluded it, Miss West promptly demanded if the realists might
not be fooled by their own phrases as often and as completely as
were the poor common mortals with the vital lies they never
questioned.</p>
<p>And there we were.&nbsp; An ordinary young woman, who had
never vexed her brains with ultimate problems, hears such things
stated for the first time, and immediately, and with a laugh,
sweeps them all away.&nbsp; I doubt not that De Casseres would
have agreed with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you believe in God?&rdquo; I asked rather
abruptly.&nbsp; She dropped her sewing into her lap, looked at me
meditatively, then gazed on and away across the flashing sea and
up into the azure dome of sky.&nbsp; And finally, with true
feminine evasion, she replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you?&rdquo; I insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t bother
my head about such things.&nbsp; I used to when I was a little
girl.&nbsp; And yet . . . yes, surely I believe in God.&nbsp; At
times, when I am not thinking about it at all, I am very sure,
and my faith that all is well is just as strong as the faith of
your Jewish friend in the phrases of the philosophers.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s all it comes to, I suppose, in every
case&mdash;faith.&nbsp; But, as I say, why bother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I have you now, Miss West!&rdquo; I cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You are a true daughter of Herodias.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t sound nice,&rdquo; she said with a
<i>moue</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I exulted.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Nevertheless, it is what you are.&nbsp; It is Arthur
Symon&rsquo;s poem, <i>The Daughters of Herodias</i>.&nbsp; Some
day I shall read it to you, and you will answer.&nbsp; I know you
will answer that you, too, have looked often upon the
stars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We had just got upon the subject of music, of which she
possesses a surprisingly solid knowledge, and she was telling me
that Debussy and his school held no particular charm for her,
when Possum set up a wild yelping.</p>
<p>The puppy had strayed for&rsquo;ard along the bridge to the
&rsquo;midship-house, and had evidently been investigating the
chickens when his disaster came upon him.&nbsp; So shrill was his
terror that we both stood up.&nbsp; He was dashing along the
bridge toward us at full speed, yelping at every jump and
continually turning his head back in the direction whence he
came.</p>
<p>I spoke to him and held out my hand, and was rewarded with a
snap and clash of teeth as he scuttled past.&nbsp; Still with
head turned back, he went on along the poop.&nbsp; Before I could
apprehend his danger, Mr. Pike and Miss West were after
him.&nbsp; The mate was the nearer, and with a magnificent leap
gained the rail just in time to intercept Possum, who was blindly
going overboard under the slender railing.&nbsp; With a sort of
scooping kick Mr. Pike sent the animal rolling half across the
poop.&nbsp; Howling and snapping more violently, Possum regained
his feet and staggered on toward the opposite railing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch him!&rdquo; Mr. Pike cried, as Miss
West showed her intention of catching the crazed little animal
with her hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch&rsquo;m!&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s got a fit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it did not deter her.&nbsp; He was half-way under the
railing when she caught him up and held him at arm&rsquo;s length
while he howled and barked and slavered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fit,&rdquo; said Mr. Pike, as the terrier
collapsed and lay on the deck jerking convulsively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps a chicken pecked him,&rdquo; said Miss
West.&nbsp; &ldquo;At any rate, get a bucket of water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better let me take him,&rdquo; I volunteered
helplessly, for I was unfamiliar with fits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; it&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; she answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take charge of him.&nbsp; The cold water is
what he needs.&nbsp; He got too close to the coop, and a peck on
the nose frightened him into the fit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First time I ever heard of a fit coming that
way,&rdquo; Mr. Pike remarked, as he poured water over the puppy
under Miss West&rsquo;s direction.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a
plain puppy fit.&nbsp; They all get them at sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it was the sails that caused it,&rdquo; I
argued.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve noticed that he is very afraid of
them.&nbsp; When they flap, he crouches down in terror and starts
to run.&nbsp; You noticed how he ran with his head turned
back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen dogs with fits do that when there was
nothing to frighten them,&rdquo; Mr. Pike contended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a fit, no matter what caused it,&rdquo; Miss
West stated conclusively.&nbsp; &ldquo;Which means that he has
not been fed properly.&nbsp; From now on I shall feed him.&nbsp;
You tell your boy that, Mr. Pathurst.&nbsp; Nobody is to feed
Possum anything without my permission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this juncture Wada arrived with Possum&rsquo;s little
sleeping box, and they prepared to take him below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was splendid of you, Miss West,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;and rash, as well, and I won&rsquo;t attempt to thank
you.&nbsp; But I tell you what-you take him.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s
your dog now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed and shook her head as I opened the chart-house
door for her to pass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; but I&rsquo;ll take care of him for you.&nbsp; Now
don&rsquo;t bother to come below.&nbsp; This is my affair, and
you would only be in the way.&nbsp; Wada will help me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I was rather surprised, as I returned to my deck chair and
sat down, to find how affected I was by the little episode.&nbsp;
I remembered, at the first, that my pulse had been distinctly
accelerated with the excitement of what had taken place.&nbsp;
And somehow, as I leaned back in my chair and lighted a
cigarette, the strangeness of the whole voyage vividly came to
me.&nbsp; Miss West and I talk philosophy and art on the poop of
a stately ship in a circle of flashing sea, while Captain West
dreams of his far home, and Mr. Pike and Mr. Mellaire stand watch
and watch and snarl orders, and the slaves of men pull and haul,
and Possum has fits, and Andy Fay and Mulligan Jacobs burn with
hatred unconsumable, and the small-handed half-caste Chinese
cooks for all, and Sundry Buyers perpetually presses his abdomen,
and O&rsquo;Sullivan raves in the steel cell of the
&rsquo;midship-house, and Charles Davis lies about him nursing a
marlin-spike, and Christian Jespersen, miles astern, is deep sunk
in the sea with a sack of coal at his feet.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<p>Two weeks out to-day, on a balmy sea, under a cloud-flecked
sky, and slipping an easy eight knots through the water to a
light easterly wind.&nbsp; Captain West said he was almost
convinced that it was the north-east trade.&nbsp; Also, I have
learned that the <i>Elsinore</i>, in order to avoid being jammed
down on Cape San Roque, on the Brazil coast, must first fight
eastward almost to the coast of Africa.&nbsp; On occasion, on
this traverse, the Cape Verde Islands are raised.&nbsp; No wonder
the voyage from Baltimore to Seattle is reckoned at eighteen
thousand miles.</p>
<p>I found Tony, the suicidal Greek, steering this morning when I
came on deck.&nbsp; He seemed sensible enough, and quite
rationally took off his hat when I said good morning to
him.&nbsp; The sick men are improving nicely, with the exceptions
of Charles Davis and O&rsquo;Sullivan.&nbsp; The latter still is
lashed to his bunk, and Mr. Pike has compelled Davis to attend on
him.&nbsp; As a result, Davis moves about the deck, bringing food
and water from the galley and grumbling his wrongs to every
member of the crew.</p>
<p>Wada told me a strange thing this morning.&nbsp; It seems that
he, the steward, and the two sail-makers foregather each evening
in the cook&rsquo;s room&mdash;all being Asiatics&mdash;where
they talk over ship&rsquo;s gossip.&nbsp; They seem to miss
little, and Wada brings it all to me.&nbsp; The thing Wada told
me was the curious conduct of Mr. Mellaire.&nbsp; They have sat
in judgment on him and they do not approve of his intimacy with
the three gangsters for&rsquo;ard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Wada,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;he is not that kind of
a man.&nbsp; He is very hard and rough with all the
sailors.&nbsp; He treats them like dogs.&nbsp; You know
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; assented Wada.&nbsp; &ldquo;Other sailors
he do that.&nbsp; But those three very bad men he make good
friends.&nbsp; Louis say second mate belong aft like first mate
and captain.&nbsp; No good for second mate talk like friend with
sailors.&nbsp; No good for ship.&nbsp; Bime by trouble.&nbsp; You
see.&nbsp; Louis say Mr. Mellaire crazy do that kind funny
business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of which, if it were true, and I saw no reason to doubt
it, led me to inquire.&nbsp; It seems that the gangsters, Kid
Twist, Nosey Murphy, and Bert Rhine, have made themselves cocks
of the forecastle.&nbsp; Standing together, they have established
a reign of terror and are ruling the forecastle.&nbsp; All their
training in New York in ruling the slum brutes and weaklings in
their gangs fits them for the part.&nbsp; As near as I could make
out from Wada&rsquo;s tale, they first began on the two Italians
in their watch, Guido Bombini and Mike Cipriani.&nbsp; By means I
cannot guess, they have reduced these two wretches to trembling
slaves.&nbsp; As an instance, the other night, according to the
ship&rsquo;s gossip, Bert Rhine made Bombini get out of bed and
fetch him a drink of water.</p>
<p>Isaac Chantz is likewise under their rule, though he is
treated more kindly.&nbsp; Herman Lunkenheimer, a good-natured
but simple-minded dolt of a German, received a severe beating
from the three because he refused to wash some of Nosey
Murphy&rsquo;s dirty garments.&nbsp; The two bosuns are in fear
of their lives with this clique, which is growing; for Steve
Roberts, the ex-cowboy, and the white-slaver, Arthur Deacon, have
been admitted to it.</p>
<p>I am the only one aft who possesses this information, and I
confess I don&rsquo;t know what to do with it.&nbsp; I know that
Mr. Pike would tell me to mind my own business.&nbsp; Mr.
Mellaire is out of the question.&nbsp; And Captain West
hasn&rsquo;t any crew.&nbsp; And I fear Miss West would laugh at
me for my pains.&nbsp; Besides, I understand that every
forecastle has its bully, or group of bullies; so this is merely
a forecastle matter and no concern of the afterguard.&nbsp; The
ship&rsquo;s work goes on.&nbsp; The only effect I can conjecture
is an increase in the woes of the unfortunates who must bow to
this petty tyranny for&rsquo;ard.</p>
<p>&mdash;Oh, and another thing Wada told me.&nbsp; The gangster
clique has established its privilege of taking first cut of the
salt-beef in the meat-kids.&nbsp; After that, the rest take the
rejected pieces.&nbsp; But I will say, contrary to my
expectations, the <i>Elsinore&rsquo;s</i> forecastle is well
found.&nbsp; The men are not on whack.&nbsp; They have all they
want to eat.&nbsp; A barrel of good hardtack stands always open
in the forecastle.&nbsp; Louis bakes fresh bread for the sailors
three times a week.&nbsp; The variety of food is excellent, if
not the quality.&nbsp; There is no restriction in the amount of
water for drinking purposes.&nbsp; And I can only say that in
this good weather the men&rsquo;s appearance improves daily.</p>
<p>Possum is very sick.&nbsp; Each day he grows thinner.&nbsp;
Scarcely can I call him a perambulating skeleton, because he is
too weak to walk.&nbsp; Each day, in this delightful weather,
Wada, under Miss West&rsquo;s instructions, brings him up in his
box and places him out of the wind on the awninged poop.&nbsp;
She has taken full charge of the puppy, and has him sleep in her
room each night.&nbsp; I found her yesterday, in the chart-room,
reading up the <i>Elsinore&rsquo;s</i> medical library.&nbsp;
Later on she overhauled the medicine-chest.&nbsp; She is
essentially the life-giving, life-conserving female of the
species.&nbsp; All her ways, for herself and for others, make
toward life.</p>
<p>And yet&mdash;and this is so curious it gives me
pause&mdash;she shows no interest in the sick and injured
for&rsquo;ard.</p>
<p>They are to her cattle, or less than cattle.&nbsp; As the
life-giver and race-conserver, I should have imagined her a Lady
Bountiful, tripping regularly into that ghastly steel-walled
hospital room of the midship-house and dispensing gruel,
sunshine, and even tracts.&nbsp; On the contrary, as with her
father, these wretched humans do not exist.</p>
<p>And still again, when the steward jammed a splinter under his
nail, she was greatly concerned, and manipulated the tweezers and
pulled it out.&nbsp; The Elsinore reminds me of a slave
plantation before the war; and Miss West is the lady of the
plantation, interested only in the house-slaves.&nbsp; The field
slaves are beyond her ken or consideration, and the sailors are
the Elsinore&rsquo;s field slaves.&nbsp; Why, several days back,
when Wada suffered from a severe headache, she was quite
perturbed, and dosed him with aspirin.&nbsp; Well, I suppose this
is all due to her sea-training.&nbsp; She has been trained
hard.</p>
<p>We have the phonograph in the second dog-watch every other
evening in this fine weather.&nbsp; On the alternate evenings
this period is Mr. Pike&rsquo;s watch on deck.&nbsp; But when it
is his evening below, even at dinner, he betrays his anticipation
by an eagerness ill suppressed.&nbsp; And yet, on each such
occasion, he punctiliously waits until we ask if we are to be
favoured with music.&nbsp; Then his hard-bitten face lights up,
although the lines remain hard as ever, hiding his ecstasy, and
he remarks gruffly, off-handedly, that he guesses he can play
over a few records.&nbsp; And so, every other evening, we watch
this killer and driver, with lacerated knuckles and gorilla paws,
brushing and caressing his beloved discs, ravished with the music
of them, and, as he told me early in the voyage, at such moments
believing in God.</p>
<p>A strange experience is this life on the Elsinore.&nbsp; I
confess, while it seems that I have been here for long months, so
familiar am I with every detail of the little round of living,
that I cannot orient myself.&nbsp; My mind continually strays
from things non-understandable to things
incomprehensible&mdash;from our Samurai captain with the
exquisite Gabriel voice that is heard only in the tumult and
thunder of storm; on to the ill-treated and feeble-minded faun
with the bright, liquid, pain-filled eyes; to the three gangsters
who rule the forecastle and seduce the second mate; to the
perpetually muttering O&rsquo;Sullivan in the steel-walled hole
and the complaining Davis nursing the marlin-spike in the upper
bunk; and to Christian Jespersen somewhere adrift in this
vastitude of ocean with a coal-sack at his feet.&nbsp; At such
moments all the life on the <i>Elsinore</i> becomes as unreal as
life to the philosopher is unreal.</p>
<p>I am a philosopher.&nbsp; Therefore, it is unreal to me.&nbsp;
But is it unreal to Messrs.&nbsp; Pike and Mellaire? to the
lunatics and idiots? to the rest of the stupid herd
for&rsquo;ard?&nbsp; I cannot help remembering a remark of De
Casseres.&nbsp; It was over the wine in Mouquin&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
Said he: &ldquo;The profoundest instinct in man is to war against
the truth; that is, against the Real.&nbsp; He shuns facts from
his infancy.&nbsp; His life is a perpetual evasion.&nbsp;
Miracle, chimera and to-morrow keep him alive.&nbsp; He lives on
fiction and myth.&nbsp; It is the Lie that makes him free.&nbsp;
Animals alone are given the privilege of lifting the veil of
Isis; men dare not.&nbsp; The animal, awake, has no fictional
escape from the Real because he has no imagination.&nbsp; Man,
awake, is compelled to seek a perpetual escape into Hope, Belief,
Fable, Art, God, Socialism, Immortality, Alcohol, Love.&nbsp;
From Medusa-Truth he makes an appeal to Maya-Lie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ben will agree that I have quoted him fairly.&nbsp; And so,
the thought comes to me, that to all these slaves of the
<i>Elsinore</i> the Real is real because they fictionally escape
it.&nbsp; One and all they are obsessed with the belief that they
are free agents.&nbsp; To me the Real is unreal, because I have
torn aside the veils of fiction and myth.&nbsp; My pristine
fictional escape from the Real, making me a philosopher, has
bound me absolutely to the wheel of the Real.&nbsp; I, the
super-realist, am the only unrealist on board the
<i>Elsinore</i>.&nbsp; Therefore I, who penetrate it deepest, in
the whole phenomena of living on the <i>Elsinore</i> see it only
as phantasmagoria.</p>
<p>Paradoxes?&nbsp; I admit it.&nbsp; All deep thinkers are
drowned in the sea of contradictions.&nbsp; But all the others on
the <i>Elsinore</i>, sheer surface swimmers, keep afloat on this
sea&mdash;forsooth, because they have never dreamed its
depth.&nbsp; And I can easily imagine what Miss West&rsquo;s
practical, hard-headed judgment would be on these speculations of
mine.&nbsp; After all, words are traps.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know
what I know, nor what I think I think.</p>
<p>This I do know: I cannot orient myself.&nbsp; I am the maddest
and most sea-lost soul on board.&nbsp; Take Miss West.&nbsp; I am
beginning to admire her.&nbsp; Why, I know not, unless it be
because she is so abominably healthy.&nbsp; And yet, it is this
very health of her, the absence of any shred of degenerative
genius, that prevents her from being great . . . for instance, in
her music.</p>
<p>A number of times, now, I have come in during the day to
listen to her playing.&nbsp; The piano is good, and her teaching
has evidently been of the best.&nbsp; To my astonishment I learn
that she is a graduate of Bryn Mawr, and that her father took a
degree from old Bowdoin long ago.&nbsp; And yet she lacks in her
music.</p>
<p>Her touch is masterful.&nbsp; She has the firmness and weight
(without sharpness or pounding) of a man&rsquo;s
playing&mdash;the strength and surety that most women lack and
that some women know they lack.&nbsp; When she makes a slip she
is ruthless with herself, and replays until the difficulty is
overcome.&nbsp; And she is quick to overcome it.</p>
<p>Yes, and there is a sort of temperament in her work, but there
is no sentiment, no fire.&nbsp; When she plays Chopin, she
interprets his sureness and neatness.&nbsp; She is the master of
Chopin&rsquo;s technique, but she never walks where Chopin walks
on the heights.&nbsp; Somehow, she stops short of the fulness of
music.</p>
<p>I did like her method with Brahms, and she was not unwilling,
at my suggestion, to go over and over the Three Rhapsodies.&nbsp;
On the Third Intermezzo she was at her best, and a good best it
was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were talking of Debussy,&rdquo; she remarked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got some of his stuff here.&nbsp; But I
don&rsquo;t get into it.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t understand it, and
there is no use in trying.&nbsp; It doesn&rsquo;t seem altogether
like real music to me.&nbsp; It fails to get hold of me, just as
I fail to get hold of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet you like MacDowell,&rdquo; I challenged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y. . . es,&rdquo; she admitted grudgingly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;His New England Idylls and Fireside Tales.&nbsp; And I
like that Finnish man&rsquo;s stuff, Sibelius, too, although it
seems to me too soft, too richly soft, too beautiful, if you know
what I mean.&nbsp; It seems to cloy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What a pity, I thought, that with that noble masculine touch
of hers she is unaware of the deeps of music.&nbsp; Some day I
shall try to get from her just what Beethoven, say, and Chopin,
mean to her.&nbsp; She has not read Shaw&rsquo;s <i>Perfect
Wagnerite</i>, nor had she ever heard of Nietzsche&rsquo;s
<i>Case of Wagner</i>.&nbsp; She likes Mozart, and old
Boccherini, and Leonardo Leo.&nbsp; Likewise she is partial to
Schumann, especially Forest Scenes.&nbsp; And she played his
Papillons most brilliantly.&nbsp; When I closed my eyes I could
have sworn it was a man&rsquo;s fingers on the keys.</p>
<p>And yet, I must say it, in the long run her playing makes me
nervous.&nbsp; I am continually led up to false
expectations.&nbsp; Always, she seems just on the verge of
achieving the big thing, the super-big thing, and always she just
misses it by a shade.&nbsp; Just as I am prepared for the
culminating flash and illumination, I receive more perfection of
technique.&nbsp; She is cold.&nbsp; She must be cold . . . Or
else, and the theory is worth considering, she is too
healthy.</p>
<p>I shall certainly read to her <i>The Daughters of
Herodias</i>.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<p>Was there ever such a voyage!&nbsp; This morning, when I came
on deck, I found nobody at the wheel.&nbsp; It was a startling
sight&mdash;the great <i>Elsinore</i>, by the wind, under an
Alpine range of canvas, every sail set from skysails to try-sails
and spanker, slipping across the surface of a mild trade-wind
sea, and no hand at the wheel to guide her.</p>
<p>No one was on the poop.&nbsp; It was Mr. Pike&rsquo;s watch,
and I strolled for&rsquo;ard along the bridge to find him.&nbsp;
He was on Number One hatch giving some instructions to the
sail-makers.&nbsp; I awaited my chance, until he glanced up and
greeted me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; I answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;And what
man is at the wheel now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That crazy Greek, Tony,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A month&rsquo;s wages to a pound of tobacco he
isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I offered.</p>
<p>Mr. Pike looked at me with quick sharpness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is at the wheel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>And then he exploded into action.&nbsp; The age-lag left his
massive frame, and he bounded aft along the deck at a speed no
man on board could have exceeded; and I doubt if very many could
have equalled it.&nbsp; He went up the poop-ladder three steps at
a time and disappeared in the direction of the wheel behind the
chart-house.</p>
<p>Next came a promptitude of bellowed orders, and all the watch
was slacking away after braces to starboard and pulling on after
braces to port.&nbsp; I had already learned the manoeuvre.&nbsp;
Mr. Pike was wearing ship.</p>
<p>As I returned aft along the bridge Mr. Mellaire and the
carpenter emerged from the cabin door.&nbsp; They had been
interrupted at breakfast, for they were wiping their
mouths.&nbsp; Mr. Pike came to the break of the poop, called down
instructions to the second mate, who proceeded for&rsquo;ard, and
ordered the carpenter to take the wheel.</p>
<p>As the <i>Elsinore</i> swung around on her heel Mr. Pike put
her on the back track so as to cover the water she had just
crossed over.&nbsp; He lowered the glasses through which he was
scanning the sea and pointed down the hatchway that opened into
the big after-room beneath.&nbsp; The ladder was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must have taken the lazarette ladder with him,&rdquo;
said Mr. Pike.</p>
<p>Captain West strolled out of the chart-room.&nbsp; He said
good morning in his customary way, courteously to me and formally
to the mate, and strolled on along the poop to the wheel, where
he paused to glance into the binnacle.&nbsp; Turning, he went on
leisurely to the break of the poop.&nbsp; Again he came back to
us.&nbsp; Fully two minutes must have elapsed ere he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter, Mr. Pike?&nbsp; Man
overboard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And took the lazarette ladder along with him?&rdquo;
Captain West queried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the Greek that jumped over
at Baltimore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Evidently the affair was not serious enough for Captain West
to be the Samurai.&nbsp; He lighted a cigar and resumed his
stroll.&nbsp; And yet he had missed nothing, not even the absence
of the ladder.</p>
<p>Mr. Pike sent look-outs aloft to every skysail-yard, and the
<i>Elsinore</i> slipped along through the smooth sea.&nbsp; Miss
West came up and stood beside me, searching the ocean with her
eyes while I told her the little I knew.&nbsp; She evidenced no
excitement, and reassured me by telling me how difficult it was
to lose a man of Tony&rsquo;s suicidal type.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their madness always seems to come upon them in fine
weather or under safe circumstances,&rdquo; she smiled,
&ldquo;when a boat can be lowered or a tug is alongside.&nbsp;
And sometimes they take life&mdash;preservers with them, as in
this case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the end of an hour Mr. Pike wore the <i>Elsinore</i>
around, and again retraced the course she must have been sailing
when the Greek went over.&nbsp; Captain West still strolled and
smoked, and Miss West made a brief trip below to give Wada
forgotten instructions about Possum.&nbsp; Andy Pay was called to
the wheel, and the carpenter went below to finish his
breakfast.</p>
<p>It all seemed rather callous to me.&nbsp; Nobody was much
concerned for the man who was overboard somewhere on that lonely
ocean.&nbsp; And yet I had to admit that everything possible was
being done to find him.&nbsp; I talked a little with Mr. Pike,
and he seemed more vexed than anything else.&nbsp; He disliked to
have the ship&rsquo;s work interrupted in such fashion.</p>
<p>Mr. Mellaire&rsquo;s attitude was different.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are short-handed enough as it is,&rdquo; he told me,
when he joined us on the poop.&nbsp; &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t afford
to lose him even if he is crazy.&nbsp; We need him.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s a good sailor most of the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hail came from the mizzen-skysail-yard.&nbsp; The Maltese
Cockney it was who first sighted the man and called down the
information.&nbsp; The mate, looking to windwards, suddenly
lowered his glasses, rubbed his eyes in a puzzled way, and looked
again.&nbsp; Then Miss West, using another pair of glasses, cried
out in surprise and began to laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you make of it, Miss West?&rdquo; the mate
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t seem to be in the water.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s standing up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Pike nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s on the ladder,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d forgotten that.&nbsp; It fooled me at
first.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t understand it.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
turned to the second mate.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. Mellaire, will you
launch the long boat and get some kind of a crew into it while I
back the main-yard?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll go in the boat.&nbsp; Pick
men that can pull an oar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go, too,&rdquo; Miss West said to me.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It will be an opportunity to get outside the
<i>Elsinore</i> and see her under full sail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Pike nodded consent, so I went along, sitting near him in
the stern-sheets where he steered, while half a dozen hands rowed
us toward the suicide, who stood so weirdly upon the surface of
the sea.&nbsp; The Maltese Cockney pulled the stroke oar, and
among the other five men was one whose name I had but recently
learned&mdash;Ditman Olansen, a Norwegian.&nbsp; A good seaman,
Mr. Mellaire had told me, in whose watch he was; a good seaman,
but &ldquo;crank-eyed.&rdquo;&nbsp; When pressed for an
explanation Mr. Mellaire had said that he was the sort of man who
flew into blind rages, and that one never could tell what little
thing would produce such a rage.&nbsp; As near as I could grasp
it, Ditman Olansen was a Berserker type.&nbsp; Yet, as I watched
him pulling in good time at the oar, his large, pale-blue eyes
seemed almost bovine&mdash;the last man in the world, in my
judgment, to have a Berserker fit.</p>
<p>As we drew close to the Greek he began to scream menacingly at
us and to brandish a sheath-knife.&nbsp; His weight sank the
ladder until the water washed his knees, and on this submerged
support he balanced himself with wild writhing and outflinging of
arms.&nbsp; His face, grimacing like a monkey&rsquo;s, was not a
pretty thing to look upon.&nbsp; And as he continued to threaten
us with the knife I wondered how the problem of rescuing him
would be solved.</p>
<p>But I should have trusted Mr. Pike for that.&nbsp; He removed
the boat-stretcher from under the Maltese Cockney&rsquo;s feet
and laid it close to hand in the stern-sheets.&nbsp; Then he had
the men reverse the boat and back it upon the Greek.&nbsp;
Dodging a sweep of the knife, Mr. Pike awaited his chance, until
a passing wave lifted the boat&rsquo;s stern high, while Tony was
sinking toward the trough.&nbsp; This was the moment.&nbsp; Again
I was favoured with a sample of the lightning speed with which
that aged man of sixty-nine could handle his body.&nbsp; Timed
precisely, and delivered in a flash and with weight, the
boat-stretcher came down on the Greek&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; The
knife fell into the sea, and the demented creature collapsed and
followed it, knocked unconscious.&nbsp; Mr. Pike scooped him out,
quite effortlessly it seemed to me, and flung him into the
boat&rsquo;s bottom at my feet.</p>
<p>The next moment the men were bending to their oars and the
mate was steering back to the <i>Elsinore</i>.&nbsp; It was a
stout rap Mr. Pike had administered with the
boat-stretcher.&nbsp; Thin streaks of blood oozed on the damp,
plastered hair from the broken scalp.&nbsp; I could but stare at
the lump of unconscious flesh that dripped sea-water at my
feet.&nbsp; A man, all life and movement one moment, defying the
universe, reduced the next moment to immobility and the blackness
and blankness of death, is always a fascinating object for the
contemplative eye of the philosopher.&nbsp; And in this case it
had been accomplished so simply, by means of a stick of wood
brought sharply in contact with his skull.</p>
<p>If Tony the Greek be accounted an <i>appearance</i>, what was
he now?&mdash;a <i>disappearance</i>?&nbsp; And if so, whither
had he disappeared?&nbsp; And whence would he journey back to
reoccupy that body when what we call consciousness returned to
him?&nbsp; The first word, much less the last, of the phenomena
of personality and consciousness yet remains to be uttered by the
psychologists.</p>
<p>Pondering thus, I chanced to lift my eyes, and the glorious
spectacle of the <i>Elsinore</i> burst upon me.&nbsp; I had been
so long on board, and in board of her, that I had forgotten she
was a white-painted ship.&nbsp; So low to the water was her hull,
so delicate and slender, that the tall, sky-reaching spars and
masts and the hugeness of the spread of canvas seemed
preposterous and impossible, an insolent derision of the law of
gravitation.&nbsp; It required effort to realize that that slim
curve of hull inclosed and bore up from the sea&rsquo;s bottom
five thousand tons of coal.&nbsp; And again, it seemed a miracle
that the mites of men had conceived and constructed so stately
and magnificent an element-defying fabric&mdash;mites of men,
most woefully like the Greek at my feet, prone to precipitation
into the blackness by means of a rap on the head with a piece of
wood.</p>
<p>Tony made a struggling noise in his throat, then coughed and
groaned.&nbsp; From somewhere he was reappearing.&nbsp; I noticed
Mr. Pike look at him quickly, as if apprehending some
recrudescence of frenzy that would require more
boat-stretcher.&nbsp; But Tony merely fluttered his big black
eyes open and stared at me for a long minute of incurious amaze
ere he closed them again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do with him?&rdquo; I asked the
mate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put &rsquo;m back to work,&rdquo; was the reply.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all he&rsquo;s good for, and he ain&rsquo;t
hurt.&nbsp; Somebody&rsquo;s got to work this ship around the
Horn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When we hoisted the boat on board I found Miss West had gone
below.&nbsp; In the chart-room Captain West was winding the
chronometers.&nbsp; Mr. Mellaire had turned in to catch an hour
or two of sleep ere his watch on deck at noon.&nbsp; Mr.
Mellaire, by the way, as I have forgotten to state, does not
sleep aft.&nbsp; He shares a room in the &rsquo;midship-house
with Mr. Pike&rsquo;s Nancy.</p>
<p>Nobody showed sympathy for the unfortunate Greek.&nbsp; He was
bundled out upon Number Two hatch like so much carrion and left
there unattended, to recover consciousness as he might
elect.&nbsp; Yes, and so inured have I become that I make free to
admit I felt no sympathy for him myself.&nbsp; My eyes were still
filled with the beauty of the <i>Elsinore</i>.&nbsp; One does
grow hard at sea.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<p>One does not mind the trades.&nbsp; We have held the
north-east trade for days now, and the miles roll off behind us
as the patent log whirls and tinkles on the taffrail.&nbsp;
Yesterday, log and observation approximated a run of two hundred
and fifty-two miles; the day before we ran two hundred and forty,
and the day before that two hundred and sixty-one.&nbsp; But one
does not appreciate the force of the wind.&nbsp; So balmy and
exhilarating is it that it is so much atmospheric wine.&nbsp; I
delight to open my lungs and my pores to it.&nbsp; Nor does it
chill.&nbsp; At any hour of the night, while the cabin lies
asleep, I break off from my reading and go up on the poop in the
thinnest of tropical pyjamas.</p>
<p>I never knew before what the trade wind was.&nbsp; And now I
am infatuated with it.&nbsp; I stroll up and down for an hour at
a time, with whichever mate has the watch.&nbsp; Mr. Mellaire is
always full-garmented, but Mr. Pike, on these delicious nights,
stands his first watch after midnight in his pyjamas.&nbsp; He is
a fearfully muscular man.&nbsp; Sixty-nine years seem impossible
when I see his single, slimpsy garments pressed like fleshings
against his form and bulged by heavy bone and huge muscle.&nbsp;
A splendid figure of a man!&nbsp; What he must have been in the
hey-day of youth two score years and more ago passes
comprehension.</p>
<p>The days, so filled with simple routine, pass as in a
dream.&nbsp; Here, where time is rigidly measured and emphasized
by the changing of the watches, where every hour and half-hour is
persistently brought to one&rsquo;s notice by the striking of the
ship&rsquo;s bells fore and aft, time ceases.&nbsp; Days merge
into days, and weeks slip into weeks, and I, for one, can never
remember the day of the week or month.</p>
<p>The <i>Elsinore</i> is never totally asleep.&nbsp; Day and
night, always, there are the men on watch, the look-out on the
forecastle head, the man at the wheel, and the officer of the
deck.&nbsp; I lie reading in my bunk, which is on the weather
side, and continually over my head during the long night hours
impact the footsteps of one mate or the other, pacing up and
down, and, as I well know, the man himself is for ever peering
for&rsquo;ard from the break of the poop, or glancing into the
binnacle, or feeling and gauging the weight and direction of wind
on his cheek, or watching the cloud-stuff in the sky adrift and
a-scud across the stars and the moon.&nbsp; Always, always, there
are wakeful eyes on the <i>Elsinore</i>.</p>
<p>Last night, or this morning, rather, about two o&rsquo;clock,
as I lay with the printed page swimming drowsily before me, I was
aroused by an abrupt outbreak of snarl from Mr. Pike.&nbsp; I
located him as at the break of the poop; and the man at whom he
snarled was Larry, evidently on the main deck beneath him.&nbsp;
Not until Wada brought me breakfast did I learn what had
occurred.</p>
<p>Larry, with his funny pug nose, his curiously flat and twisted
face, and his querulous, plaintive chimpanzee eyes, had been
moved by some unlucky whim to venture an insolent remark under
the cover of darkness on the main deck.&nbsp; But Mr. Pike, from
above, at the break of the poop, had picked the offender
unerringly.&nbsp; This was when the explosion occurred.&nbsp;
Then the unfortunate Larry, truly half-devil and all child, had
waxed sullen and retorted still more insolently; and the next he
knew, the mate, descending upon him like a hurricane, had
handcuffed him to the mizzen fife-rail.</p>
<p>Imagine, on Mr. Pike&rsquo;s part, that this was one for Larry
and at least ten for Kid Twist, Nosey Murphy, and Bert
Rhine.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll not be so absurd as to say that the mate
is afraid of those gangsters.&nbsp; I doubt if he has ever
experienced fear.&nbsp; It is not in him.&nbsp; On the other
hand, I am confident that he apprehends trouble from these men,
and that it was for their benefit he made this example of
Larry.</p>
<p>Larry could stand no more than an hour in irons, at which time
his stupid brutishness overcame any fear he might have possessed,
because he bellowed out to the poop to come down and loose him
for a fair fight.&nbsp; Promptly Mr. Pike was there with the key
to the handcuffs.&nbsp; As if Larry had the shred of a chance
against that redoubtable aged man!&nbsp; Wada reported that
Larry, amongst other things, had lost a couple of front teeth and
was laid up in his bunk for the day.&nbsp; When I met Mr. Pike on
deck after eight o&rsquo;clock I glanced at his knuckles.&nbsp;
They verified Wada&rsquo;s tale.</p>
<p>I cannot help being amused by the keen interest I take in
little events like the foregoing.&nbsp; Not only has time ceased,
but the world has ceased.&nbsp; Strange it is, when I come to
think of it, in all these weeks I have received no letter, no
telephone call, no telegram, no visitor.&nbsp; I have not been to
the play.&nbsp; I have not read a newspaper.&nbsp; So far as I am
concerned, there are no plays nor newspapers.&nbsp; All such
things have vanished with the vanished world.&nbsp; All that
exists is the <i>Elsinore</i>, with her queer human freightage
and her cargo of coal, cleaving a rotund of ocean of which the
skyline is a dozen miles away.</p>
<p>I am reminded of Captain Scott, frozen on his south-polar
venture, who for ten months after his death was believed by the
world to be alive.&nbsp; Not until the world learned of his death
was he anything but alive to the world.&nbsp; By the same token,
was he not alive?&nbsp; And by the same token, here on the
<i>Elsinore</i>, has not the land-world ceased?&nbsp; May not the
pupil of one&rsquo;s eye be, not merely the centre of the world,
but the world itself?&nbsp; Truly, it is tenable that the world
exists only in consciousness.&nbsp; &ldquo;The world is my
idea,&rdquo; said Schopenhauer.&nbsp; Said Jules de Gaultier,
&ldquo;The world is my invention.&rdquo;&nbsp; His dogma was that
imagination created the Real.&nbsp; Ah, me, I know that the
practical Miss West would dub my metaphysics a depressing and
unhealthful exercise of my wits.</p>
<p>To-day, in our deck chairs on the poop, I read <i>The
Daughters of Herodias</i> to Miss West.&nbsp; It was superb in
its effect&mdash;just what I had expected of her.&nbsp; She
hemstitched a fine white linen handkerchief for her father while
I read.&nbsp; (She is never idle, being so essentially a
nest-maker and comfort-producer and race-conserver; and she has a
whole pile of these handkerchiefs for her father.)</p>
<p>She smiled, how shall I say?&mdash;oh, incredulously,
triumphantly, oh, with all the sure wisdom of all the generations
of women in her warm, long gray eyes, when I read:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;But they smile innocently and dance on,<br
/>
Having no thought but this unslumbering thought:<br />
&lsquo;Am I not beautiful?&nbsp; Shall I not be loved?&rsquo;<br
/>
Be patient, for they will not understand,<br />
Not till the end of time will they put by<br />
The weaving of slow steps about men&rsquo;s hearts.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;But it is well for the world that it is so,&rdquo; was
her comment.</p>
<p>Ah, Symons knew women!&nbsp; His perfect knowledge she
attested when I read that magnificent passage:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;They do not understand that in the world<br
/>
There grows between the sunlight and the grass<br />
Anything save themselves desirable.<br />
It seems to them that the swift eyes of men<br />
Are made but to be mirrors, not to see<br />
Far-off, disastrous, unattainable things.<br />
&lsquo;For are not we,&rsquo; they say, &lsquo;the end of all?<br
/>
Why should you look beyond us?&nbsp; If you look<br />
Into the night, you will find nothing there:<br />
We also have gazed often at the stars.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; said Miss West, in the pause I
permitted in order to see how she had received the thought.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We also have gazed often at the stars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the very thing I had predicted to her face that she
would say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But wait,&rdquo; I cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let me read
on.&rdquo;&nbsp; And I read:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We, we alone among all beautiful
things,<br />
We only are real: for the rest are dreams.<br />
Why will you follow after wandering dreams<br />
When we await you?&nbsp; And you can but dream<br />
Of us, and in our image fashion them.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;True, most true,&rdquo; she murmured, while all
unconsciously pride and power mounted in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A wonderful poem,&rdquo; she conceded&mdash;nay,
proclaimed&mdash;when I had done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But do you not see . . .&rdquo;&nbsp; I began
impulsively, then abandoned the attempt.&nbsp; For how could she
see, being woman, the &ldquo;far-off, disastrous, unattainable
things,&rdquo; when she, as she so stoutly averred, had gazed
often on the stars?</p>
<p>She?&nbsp; What could she see, save what all women
see&mdash;that they only are real, and that all the rest are
dreams.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am proud to be a daughter of Herodias,&rdquo; said
Miss West.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I admitted lamely, &ldquo;we agree.&nbsp;
You remember it is what I told you you were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am grateful for the compliment,&rdquo; she said; and
in those long gray eyes of hers were limned and coloured all the
satisfaction, and self-certitude and answering complacency of
power that constitute so large a part of the seductive mystery
and mastery that is possessed by woman.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<p>Heavens!&mdash;how I read in this fine weather.&nbsp; I take
so little exercise that my sleep need is very small; and there
are so few interruptions, such as life teems with on the land,
that I read myself almost stupid.&nbsp; Recommend me a sea-voyage
any time for a man who is behind in his reading.&nbsp; I am
making up years of it.&nbsp; It is an orgy, a debauch; and I am
sure the addled sailors adjudge me the queerest creature on
board.</p>
<p>At times, so fuzzy do I get from so much reading, that I am
glad for any diversion.&nbsp; When we strike the doldrums, which
lie between the north-east and the south-east trades, I shall
have Wada assemble my little twenty-two automatic rifle and try
to learn how to shoot.&nbsp; I used to shoot, when I was a wee
lad.&nbsp; I can remember dragging a shot-gun around with me over
the hills.&nbsp; Also, I possessed an air-rifle, with which, on
great occasion, I was even able to slaughter a robin.</p>
<p>While the poop is quite large for promenading, the available
space for deck-chairs is limited to the awnings that stretch
across from either side of the chart-house and that are of the
width of the chart-house.&nbsp; This space again is restricted to
one side or the other according to the slant of the morning and
afternoon sun and the freshness of the breeze.&nbsp; Wherefore,
Miss West&rsquo;s chair and mine are most frequently side by
side.&nbsp; Captain West has a chair, which he infrequently
occupies.&nbsp; He has so little to do in the working of the
ship, taking his regular observations and working them up with
such celerity, that he is rarely in the chart-room for any length
of time.&nbsp; He elects to spend his hours in the main cabin,
not reading, not doing anything save dream with eyes wide open in
the draught of wind that pours through the open ports and door
from out the huge crojack and the jigger staysails.</p>
<p>Miss West is never idle.&nbsp; Below, in the big after-room,
she does her own laundering.&nbsp; Nor will she let the steward
touch her father&rsquo;s fine linen.&nbsp; In the main cabin she
has installed a sewing-machine.&nbsp; All hand-stitching, and
embroidering, and fancy work she does in the deck-chair beside
me.&nbsp; She avers that she loves the sea and the atmosphere of
sea-life, yet, verily, she has brought her home-things and
land-things along with her&mdash;even to her pretty china for
afternoon tea.</p>
<p>Most essentially is she the woman and home-maker.&nbsp; She is
a born cook.&nbsp; The steward and Louis prepare dishes
extraordinary and <i>de luxe</i> for the cabin table; yet Miss
West is able at a moment&rsquo;s notice to improve on these
dishes.&nbsp; She never lets any of their dishes come on the
table without first planning them or passing on them.&nbsp; She
has quick judgment, an unerring taste, and is possessed of the
needful steel of decision.&nbsp; It seems she has only to look at
a dish, no matter who has cooked it, and immediately divine its
lack or its surplusage, and prescribe a treatment that transforms
it into something indescribably different and delicious&mdash;My,
how I do eat!&nbsp; I am quite dumbfounded by the unfailing
voracity of my appetite.&nbsp; Already am I quite convinced that
I am glad Miss West is making the voyage.</p>
<p>She has sailed &ldquo;out East,&rdquo; as she quaintly calls
it, and has an enormous repertoire of tasty, spicy, Eastern
dishes.&nbsp; In the cooking of rice Louis is a master; but in
the making of the accompanying curry he fades into a blundering
amateur compared with Miss West.&nbsp; In the matter of curry she
is a sheer genius.&nbsp; How often one&rsquo;s thoughts dwell
upon food when at sea!</p>
<p>So in this trade-wind weather I see a great deal of Miss
West.&nbsp; I read all the time, and quite a good part of the
time I read aloud to her passages, and even books, with which I
am interested in trying her out.&nbsp; Then, too, such reading
gives rise to discussions, and she has not yet uttered anything
that would lead me to change my first judgment of her.&nbsp; She
is a genuine daughter of Herodias.</p>
<p>And yet she is not what one would call a cute girl.&nbsp; She
isn&rsquo;t a girl, she is a mature woman with all the freshness
of a girl.&nbsp; She has the carriage, the attitude of mind, the
aplomb of a woman, and yet she cannot be described as being in
the slightest degree stately.&nbsp; She is generous, dependable,
sensible&mdash;yes, and sensitive; and her superabundant
vitality, the vitality that makes her walk so gloriously,
discounts the maturity of her.&nbsp; Sometimes she seems all of
thirty to me; at other times, when her spirits and risibilities
are aroused, she scarcely seems thirteen.&nbsp; I shall make a
point of asking Captain West the date of the <i>Dixie&rsquo;s</i>
collision with that river steamer in San Francisco Bay.&nbsp; In
a word, she is the most normal, the most healthy, natural woman I
have ever known.</p>
<p>Yes, and she is feminine, despite, no matter how she does her
hair, that it is as invariably smooth and well-groomed as all the
rest of her.&nbsp; On the other hand, this perpetual
well-groomedness is relieved by the latitude of dress she allows
herself.&nbsp; She never fails of being a woman.&nbsp; Her sex,
and the lure of it, is ever present.&nbsp; Possibly she may
possess high collars, but I have never seen her in one on
board.&nbsp; Her blouses are always open at the throat,
disclosing one of her choicest assets, the muscular, adequate
neck, with its fine-textured garmenture of skin.&nbsp; I
embarrass myself by stealing long glances at that bare throat of
hers and at the hint of fine, firm-surfaced shoulder.</p>
<p>Visiting the chickens has developed into a regular
function.&nbsp; At least once each day we make the journey
for&rsquo;ard along the bridge to the top of the
&rsquo;midship-house.&nbsp; Possum, who is now convalescent,
accompanies us.&nbsp; The steward makes a point of being there so
as to receive instructions and report the egg-output and laying
conduct of the many hens.&nbsp; At the present time our four
dozen hens are laying two dozen eggs a day, with which record
Miss West is greatly elated.</p>
<p>Already she has given names to most of them.&nbsp; The cock is
Peter, of course.&nbsp; A much-speckled hen is Dolly
Varden.&nbsp; A slim, trim thing that dogs Peter&rsquo;s heels
she calls Cleopatra.&nbsp; Another hen&mdash;the mellowest-voiced
one of all&mdash;she addresses as Bernhardt.&nbsp; One thing I
have noted: whenever she and the steward have passed death
sentence on a non-laying hen (which occurs regularly once a
week), she takes no part in the eating of the meat, not even when
it is metamorphosed into one of her delectable curries.&nbsp; At
such times she has a special curry made for herself of tinned
lobster, or shrimp, or tinned chicken.</p>
<p>Ah, I must not forget.&nbsp; I have learned that it was no
man-interest (in me, if you please) that brought about her sudden
interest to come on the voyage.&nbsp; It was for her father that
she came.&nbsp; Something is the matter with Captain West.&nbsp;
At rare moments I have observed her gazing at him with a world of
solicitude and anxiety in her eyes.</p>
<p>I was telling an amusing story at table yesterday midday, when
my glance chanced to rest upon Miss West.&nbsp; She was not
listening.&nbsp; Her food on her fork was suspended in the air a
sheer instant as she looked at her father with all her
eyes.&nbsp; It was a stare of fear.&nbsp; She realized that I was
observing, and with superb control, slowly, quite naturally, she
lowered the fork and rested it on her plate, retaining her hold
on it and retaining her father&rsquo;s face in her look.</p>
<p>But I had seen.&nbsp; Yes; I had seen more than that.&nbsp; I
had seen Captain West&rsquo;s face a transparent white, while his
eyelids fluttered down and his lips moved noiselessly.&nbsp; Then
the eyelids raised, the lips set again with their habitual
discipline, and the colour slowly returned to his face.&nbsp; It
was as if he had been away for a time and just returned.&nbsp;
But I had seen, and guessed her secret.</p>
<p>And yet it was this same Captain West, seven hours later, who
chastened the proud sailor spirit of Mr. Pike.&nbsp; It was in
the second dog-watch that evening, a dark night, and the watch
was pulling away on the main deck.&nbsp; I had just come out of
the chart-house door and seen Captain West pace by me, hands in
pockets, toward the break of the poop.&nbsp; Abruptly, from the
mizzen-mast, came a snap of breakage and crash of fabric.&nbsp;
At the same instant the men fell backward and sprawled over the
deck.</p>
<p>A moment of silence followed, and then Captain West&rsquo;s
voice went out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What carried away, Mr. Pike?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The halyards, sir,&rdquo; came the reply out of the
darkness.</p>
<p>There was a pause.&nbsp; Again Captain West&rsquo;s voice went
out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next time slack away on your sheet first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now Mr. Pike is incontestably a splendid seaman.&nbsp; Yet in
this instance he had been wrong.&nbsp; I have come to know him,
and I can well imagine the hurt to his pride.&nbsp; And
more&mdash;he has a wicked, resentful, primitive nature, and
though he answered respectfully enough, &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; I
felt safe in predicting to myself that the poor devils under him
would receive the weight of his resentment in the later watches
of the night.</p>
<p>They evidently did; for this morning I noted a black eye on
John Hackey, a San Francisco hoodlum, and Guido Bombini was
carrying a freshly and outrageously swollen jaw.&nbsp; I asked
Wada about the matter, and he soon brought me the news.&nbsp;
Quite a bit of beating up takes place for&rsquo;ard of the
deck-houses in the night watches while we of the after-guard
peacefully slumber.</p>
<p>Even to-day Mr. Pike is going around sullen and morose,
snarling at the men more than usual, and barely polite to Miss
West and me when we chance to address him.&nbsp; His replies are
grunted in monosyllables, and his face is set in superlative
sourness.&nbsp; Miss West who is unaware of the occurrence,
laughs and calls it a &ldquo;sea grouch&rdquo;&mdash;a phenomenon
with which she claims large experience.</p>
<p>But I know Mr. Pike now&mdash;the stubborn, wonderful old
sea-dog.&nbsp; It will be three days before he is himself
again.&nbsp; He takes a terrible pride in his seamanship, and
what hurts him most is the knowledge that he was guilty of the
blunder.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<p>To-day, twenty-eight days out, in the early morning, while I
was drinking my coffee, still carrying the north-east trade, we
crossed the line.&nbsp; And Charles Davis signalized the event by
murdering O&rsquo;Sullivan.&nbsp; It was Boney, the lanky
splinter of a youth in Mr. Mellaire&rsquo;s watch, who brought
the news.&nbsp; The second mate and I had just arrived in the
hospital room, when Mr. Pike entered.</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s troubles were over.&nbsp; The man in
the upper bunk had completed the mad, sad span of his life with
the marlin-spike.</p>
<p>I cannot understand this Charles Davis.&nbsp; He sat up calmly
in his bunk, and calmly lighted his pipe ere he replied to Mr.
Mellaire.&nbsp; He certainly is not insane.&nbsp; Yet
deliberately, in cold blood, he has murdered a helpless man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;d you do it for?&rdquo; Mr. Mellaire
demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, sir,&rdquo; said Charles Davis, applying a
second match to his pipe, &ldquo;because&rdquo;&mdash;puff,
puff&mdash;&ldquo;he bothered my sleep.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here he
caught Mr. Pike&rsquo;s glowering eye.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Because&rdquo;&mdash;puff, puff&mdash;&ldquo;he annoyed
me.&nbsp; The next time&rdquo;&mdash;puff, puff&mdash;&ldquo;I
hope better judgment will be shown in what kind of a man is put
in with me.&nbsp; Besides&rdquo;&mdash;puff,
puff&mdash;&ldquo;this top bunk ain&rsquo;t no place for
me.&nbsp; It hurts me to get into it&rdquo;&mdash;puff,
puff&mdash;&ldquo;an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m gem&rsquo; back to that
lower bunk as soon as you get O&rsquo;Sullivan out of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;d you do it for?&rdquo; Mr. Pike
snarled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you, sir, because he annoyed me.&nbsp; I got
tired of it, an&rsquo; so, this morning, I just put him out of
his misery.&nbsp; An&rsquo; what are you goin&rsquo; to do about
it?&nbsp; The man&rsquo;s dead, ain&rsquo;t he?&nbsp; An&rsquo; I
killed &rsquo;m in self-defence.&nbsp; I know the law.&nbsp; What
right&rsquo;d you to put a ravin&rsquo; lunatic in with me,
an&rsquo; me sick an&rsquo; helpless?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By God, Davis!&rdquo; the mate burst forth.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never draw your pay-day in Seattle.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll fix you out for this, killing a crazy lashed down in
his bunk an&rsquo; harmless.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll follow &rsquo;m
overside, my hearty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I do, you&rsquo;ll hang for it, sir,&rdquo; Davis
retorted.&nbsp; He turned his cool eyes on me.&nbsp;
&ldquo;An&rsquo; I call on you, sir, to witness the threats
he&rsquo;s made.&nbsp; An&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll testify to them,
too, in court.&nbsp; An&rsquo; he&rsquo;ll hang as sure as I go
over the side.&nbsp; Oh, I know his record.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s
afraid to face a court with it.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s been up too many
a time with charges of man-killin&rsquo; an&rsquo; brutality on
the high seas.&nbsp; An&rsquo; a man could retire for life an
live off the interest of the fines he&rsquo;s paid, or his owners
paid for him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut your mouth or I&rsquo;ll knock it out of your
face!&rdquo; Mr. Pike roared, springing toward him with clenched,
up-raised fist.</p>
<p>Davis involuntarily shrank away.&nbsp; His flesh was weak, but
not so his spirit.&nbsp; He got himself promptly in hand and
struck another match.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t get my goat, sir,&rdquo; he sneered,
under the shadow of the impending blow.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
ain&rsquo;t scared to die.&nbsp; A man&rsquo;s got to die once
anyway, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s none so hard a trick to do when you
can&rsquo;t help it.&nbsp; O&rsquo;Sullivan died so easy it was
amazin&rsquo;.&nbsp; Besides, I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to
die.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to finish this voyage, an&rsquo;
sue the owners when I get to Seattle.&nbsp; I know my rights
an&rsquo; the law.&nbsp; An&rsquo; I got witnesses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truly, I was divided between admiration for the courage of
this wretched sailor and sympathy for Mr. Pike thus bearded by a
sick man he could not bring himself to strike.</p>
<p>Nevertheless he sprang upon the man with calculated fury,
gripped him between the base of the neck and the shoulders with
both gnarled paws, and shook him back and forth, violently and
frightfully, for a full minute.&nbsp; It was a wonder the
man&rsquo;s neck was not dislocated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I call on you to witness, sir,&rdquo; Davis gasped at
me the instant he was free.</p>
<p>He coughed and strangled, felt his throat, and made wry
neck-movements indicative of injury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The marks&rsquo;ll begin to show in a few
minutes,&rdquo; he murmured complacently as his dizziness left
him and his breath came back.</p>
<p>This was too much for Mr. Pike, who turned and left the room,
growling and cursing incoherently, deep in his throat.&nbsp; When
I made my departure, a moment later, Davis was refilling his pipe
and telling Mr. Mellaire that he&rsquo;d have him up for a
witness in Seattle.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>So we have had another burial at sea.&nbsp; Mr. Pike was vexed
by it because the <i>Elsinore</i>, according to sea tradition,
was going too fast through the water for a proper ceremony.&nbsp;
Thus a few minutes of the voyage were lost by backing the
<i>Elsinore&rsquo;s</i> main-topsail and deadening her way while
the service was read and O&rsquo;Sullivan was slid overboard with
the inevitable sack of coal at his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope the coal holds out,&rdquo; Mr. Pike grumbled
morosely at me five minutes later.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>And we sit on the poop, Miss West and I, tended on by
servants, sipping afternoon tea, sewing fancy work, discussing
philosophy and art, while a few feet away from us, on this tiny
floating world, all the grimy, sordid tragedy of sordid,
malformed, brutish life plays itself out.&nbsp; And Captain West,
remote, untroubled, sits dreaming in the twilight cabin while the
draught of wind from the crojack blows upon him through the open
ports.&nbsp; He has no doubts, no worries.&nbsp; He believes in
God.&nbsp; All is settled and clear and well as he nears his far
home.&nbsp; His serenity is vast and enviable.&nbsp; But I cannot
shake from my eyes that vision of him when life forsook his
veins, and his mouth slacked, and his eyelids closed, while his
face took on the white transparency of death.</p>
<p>I wonder who will be the next to finish the game and depart
with a sack of coal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, this is nothing, sir,&rdquo; Mr. Mellaire remarked
to me cheerfully as we strolled the poop during the first
watch.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was once on a voyage on a tramp steamer
loaded with four hundred Chinks&mdash;I beg your pardon,
sir&mdash;Chinese.&nbsp; They were coolies, contract labourers,
coming back from serving their time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the cholera broke out.&nbsp; We hove over three
hundred of them overboard, sir, along with both bosuns, most of
the Lascar crew, and the captain, the mate, the third mate, and
the first and third engineers.&nbsp; The second and one white
oiler was all that was left below, and I was in command on deck,
when we made port.&nbsp; The doctors wouldn&rsquo;t come
aboard.&nbsp; They made me anchor in the outer roads and told me
to heave out my dead.&nbsp; There was some tall buryin&rsquo;
about that time, Mr. Pathurst, and they went overboard without
canvas, coal, or iron.&nbsp; They had to.&nbsp; I had nobody to
help me, and the Chinks below wouldn&rsquo;t lift a hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had to go down myself, drag the bodies on to the
slings, then climb on deck and heave them up with the
donkey.&nbsp; And each trip I took a drink.&nbsp; I was pretty
drunk when the job was done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you never caught it yourself?&rdquo; I
queried.&nbsp; Mr. Mellaire held up his left hand.&nbsp; I had
often noted that the index finger was missing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all that happened to me, sir.&nbsp; The
old man&rsquo;d had a fox-terrier like yours.&nbsp; And after the
old man passed out the puppy got real, chummy with me.&nbsp; Just
as I was making the hoist of the last sling-load, what does the
puppy do but jump on my leg and sniff my hand.&nbsp; I turned to
pat him, and the next I knew my other hand had slipped into the
gears and that finger wasn&rsquo;t there any more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo; I cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;What abominable
luck to come through such a terrible experience like that and
then lose your finger!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I thought, sir,&rdquo; Mr. Mellaire
agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you do?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, just held it up and looked at it, and said
&lsquo;My goodness gracious!&rsquo; and took another
drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you didn&rsquo;t get the cholera
afterwards?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&nbsp; I reckon I was so full of alcohol the
germs dropped dead before they could get to me.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
considered a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Candidly, Mr. Pathurst, I
don&rsquo;t know about that alcohol theory.&nbsp; The old man and
the mates died drunk, and so did the third engineer.&nbsp; But
the chief was a teetotaller, and he died, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Never again shall I wonder that the sea is hard.&nbsp; I
walked apart from the second mate and stared up at the
magnificent fabric of the <i>Elsinore</i> sweeping and swaying
great blotting curves of darkness across the face of the starry
sky.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<p>Something has happened.&nbsp; But nobody knows, either fore or
aft, except the interested persons, and they will not say
anything.&nbsp; Yet the ship is abuzz with rumours and
guesses.</p>
<p>This I do know: Mr. Pike has received a fearful blow on the
head.&nbsp; At table, yesterday, at midday, I arrived late, and,
passing behind his chair, I saw a prodigious lump on top of his
head.&nbsp; When I was seated, facing him, I noted that his eyes
seemed dazed; yes, and I could see pain in them.&nbsp; He took no
part in the conversation, ate perfunctorily, behaved stupidly at
times, and it was patent that he was controlling himself with an
iron hand.</p>
<p>And nobody dares ask him what has happened.&nbsp; I know I
don&rsquo;t dare ask him, and I am a passenger, a privileged
person.&nbsp; This redoubtable old sea-relic has inspired me with
a respect for him that partakes half of timidity and half of
awe.</p>
<p>He acts as if he were suffering from concussion of the
brain.&nbsp; His pain is evident, not alone in his eyes and the
strained expression of his face, but by his conduct when he
thinks he is unobserved.&nbsp; Last night, just for a breath of
air and a moment&rsquo;s gaze at the stars, I came out of the
cabin door and stood on the main deck under the break of the
poop.&nbsp; From directly over my head came a low and persistent
groaning.&nbsp; My curiosity was aroused, and I retreated into
the cabin, came out softly on to the poop by way of the
chart-house, and strolled noiselessly for&rsquo;ard in my
slippers.&nbsp; It was Mr. Pike.&nbsp; He was leaning collapsed
on the rail, his head resting on his arms.&nbsp; He was giving
voice in secret to the pain that racked him.&nbsp; A dozen feet
away he could not be heard.&nbsp; But, close to his shoulder, I
could hear his steady, smothered groaning that seemed to take the
form of a chant.&nbsp; Also, at regular intervals, he would
mutter:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh
dear.&rdquo;&nbsp; Always he repeated the phrase five times, then
returned to his groaning.&nbsp; I stole away as silently as I had
come.</p>
<p>Yet he resolutely stands his watches and performs all his
duties of chief officer.&nbsp; Oh, I forgot.&nbsp; Miss West
dared to quiz him, and he replied that he had a toothache, and
that if it didn&rsquo;t get better he&rsquo;d pull it out.</p>
<p>Wada cannot learn what has happened.&nbsp; There were no
eye-witnesses.&nbsp; He says that the Asiatic clique, discussing
the affair in the cook&rsquo;s room, thinks the three gangsters
are responsible.&nbsp; Bert Rhine is carrying a lame
shoulder.&nbsp; Nosey Murphy is limping as from some injury in
the hips.&nbsp; And Kid Twist has been so badly beaten that he
has not left his bunk for two days.&nbsp; And that is all the
data to build on.&nbsp; The gangsters are as close-mouthed as Mr.
Pike.&nbsp; The Asiatic clique has decided that murder was
attempted and that all that saved the mate was his hard
skull.</p>
<p>Last evening, in the second dog-watch, I got another proof
that Captain West is not so oblivious of what goes on aboard the
<i>Elsinore</i> as he seems.&nbsp; I had gone for&rsquo;ard along
the bridge to the mizzen-mast, in the shadow of which I was
leaning.&nbsp; From the main deck, in the alley-way between the
&rsquo;midship-house and the rail, came the voices of Bert Rhine,
Nosey Murphy, and Mr. Mellaire.&nbsp; It was not ship&rsquo;s
work.&nbsp; They were having a friendly, even sociable chat, for
their voices hummed genially, and now and again one or another
laughed, and sometimes all laughed.</p>
<p>I remembered Wada&rsquo;s reports on this unseamanlike
intimacy of the second mate with the gangsters, and tried to make
out the nature of the conversation.&nbsp; But the gangsters were
low-voiced, and all I could catch was the tone of friendliness
and good-nature.</p>
<p>Suddenly, from the poop, came Captain West&rsquo;s
voice.&nbsp; It was the voice, not of the Samurai riding the
storm, but of the Samurai calm and cold.&nbsp; It was clear,
soft, and mellow as the mellowest bell ever cast by eastern
artificers of old time to call worshippers to prayer.&nbsp; I
know I slightly chilled to it&mdash;it was so exquisitely sweet
and yet as passionless as the ring of steel on a frosty
night.&nbsp; And I knew the effect on the men beneath me was
electrical.&nbsp; I could <i>feel</i> them stiffen and chill to
it as I had stiffened and chilled.&nbsp; And yet all he said
was:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Mellaire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; answered Mr. Mellaire, after a moment
of tense silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come aft here,&rdquo; came Captain West&rsquo;s
voice.</p>
<p>I heard the second mate move along the deck beneath me and
stop at the foot of the poop-ladder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your place is aft on the poop, Mr. Mellaire,&rdquo;
said the cold, passionless voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; answered the second mate.</p>
<p>That was all.&nbsp; Not another word was spoken.&nbsp; Captain
West resumed his stroll on the weather side of the poop, and Mr.
Mellaire, ascending the ladder, went to pacing up and down the
lee side.</p>
<p>I continued along the bridge to the forecastle head and
purposely remained there half an hour ere I returned to the cabin
by way of the main deck.&nbsp; Although I did not analyze my
motive, I knew I did not desire any one to know that I had
overheard the occurrence.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>I have made a discovery.&nbsp; Ninety per cent. of our crew is
brunette.&nbsp; Aft, with the exception of Wada and the steward,
who are our servants, we are all blonds.&nbsp; What led me to
this discovery was Woodruff&rsquo;s <i>Effects of Tropical Light
on White Men</i>, which I am just reading.&nbsp; Major
Woodruff&rsquo;s thesis is that the white-skinned, blue-eyed
Aryan, born to government and command, ever leaving his primeval,
overcast and foggy home, ever commands and governs the rest of
the world and ever perishes because of the too-white light he
encounters.&nbsp; It is a very tenable hypothesis, and will bear
looking into.</p>
<p>But to return.&nbsp; Every one of us who sits aft in the high
place is a blond Aryan.&nbsp; For&rsquo;ard, leavened with a ten
per cent, of degenerate blonds, the remaining ninety per cent, of
the slaves that toil for us are brunettes.&nbsp; They will not
perish.&nbsp; According to Woodruff, they will inherit the earth,
not because of their capacity for mastery and government, but
because of their skin-pigmentation which enables their tissues to
resist the ravages of the sun.</p>
<p>And I look at the four of us at table&mdash;Captain West, his
daughter, Mr. Pike, and myself&mdash;all fair-skinned, blue-eyed,
and perishing, yet mastering and commanding, like our fathers
before us, to the end of our type on the earth.&nbsp; Ah, well,
ours is a lordly history, and though we may be doomed to pass, in
our time we shall have trod on the faces of all peoples,
disciplined them to obedience, taught them government, and dwelt
in the palaces we have compelled them by the weight of our own
right arms to build for us.</p>
<p>The <i>Elsinore</i> depicts this in miniature.&nbsp; The best
of the food and all spacious and beautiful accommodation is
ours.&nbsp; For&rsquo;ard is a pig-sty and a slave-pen.</p>
<p>As a king, Captain West sits above all.&nbsp; As a captain of
soldiers, Mr. Pike enforces his king&rsquo;s will.&nbsp; Miss
West is a princess of the royal house.&nbsp; And I?&nbsp; Am I
not an honourable, noble-lineaged pensioner on the deeds and
achievements of my father, who, in his day, compelled thousands
of the lesser types to the building of the fortune I enjoy?</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<p>The north-west trade carried us almost into the south-east
trade, and then left us for several days to roll and swelter in
the doldrums.</p>
<p>During this time I have discovered that I have a genius for
rifle-shooting.&nbsp; Mr. Pike swore I must have had long
practice; and I confess I was myself startled by the ease of the
thing.&nbsp; Of course, it&rsquo;s the knack; but one must be so
made, I suppose, in order to be able to acquire the knack.</p>
<p>By the end of half an hour, standing on the heaving deck and
shooting at bottles floating on the rolling swell, I found that I
broke each bottle at the first shot.&nbsp; The supply of empty
bottles giving out, Mr. Pike was so interested that he had the
carpenter saw me a lot of small square blocks of hard wood.&nbsp;
These were more satisfactory.&nbsp; A well-aimed shot threw them
out of the water and spinning into the air, and I could use a
single block until it had drifted out of range.&nbsp; In an
hour&rsquo;s time I could, shooting quickly and at short range,
empty my magazine at a block and hit it nine times, and, on
occasion, ten times, out of eleven.</p>
<p>I might not have judged my aptitude as unusual, had I not
induced Miss West and Wada to try their hands.&nbsp; Neither had
luck like mine.&nbsp; I finally persuaded Mr. Pike, and he went
behind the wheel-house so that none of the crew might see how
poor a shot he was.&nbsp; He was never able to hit the mark, and
was guilty of the most ludicrous misses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never could get the hang of rifle-shooting,&rdquo; he
announced disgustedly, &ldquo;but when it comes to close range
with a gat I&rsquo;m right there.&nbsp; I guess I might as well
overhaul mine and limber it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went below and came back with a huge &rsquo;44 automatic
pistol and a handful of loaded clips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anywhere from right against the body up to ten or
twelve feet away, holding for the stomach, it&rsquo;s
astonishing, Mr. Pathurst, what you can do with a weapon like
this.&nbsp; Now you can&rsquo;t use a rifle in a mix-up.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve been down and under, with a bunch giving me the boot,
when I turned loose with this.&nbsp; Talk about damage!&nbsp; It
ranged them the full length of their bodies.&nbsp; One of
them&rsquo;d just landed his brogans on my face when I
let&rsquo;m have it.&nbsp; The bullet entered just above his
knee, smashed the collarbone, where it came out, and then clipped
off an ear.&nbsp; I guess that bullet&rsquo;s still going.&nbsp;
It took more than a full-sized man to stop it.&nbsp; So I say,
give me a good handy gat when something&rsquo;s doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you afraid you&rsquo;ll use all your
ammunition up?&rdquo; he asked anxiously half an hour later, as I
continued to crack away with my new toy.</p>
<p>He was quite reassured when I told him Wada had brought along
fifty thousand rounds for me.</p>
<p>In the midst of the shooting, two sharks came swimming
around.&nbsp; They were quite large, Mr. Pike said, and he
estimated their length at fifteen feet.&nbsp; It was Sunday
morning, so that the crew, except for working the ship, had its
time to itself, and soon the carpenter, with a rope for a
fish-line and a great iron hook baited with a chunk of salt pork
the size of my head, captured first one, and then the other, of
the monsters.&nbsp; They were hoisted in on the main deck.&nbsp;
And then I saw a spectacle of the cruelty of the sea.</p>
<p>The full crew gathered about with sheath knives, hatchets,
clubs, and big butcher knives borrowed from the galley.&nbsp; I
shall not give the details, save that they gloated and lusted,
and roared and bellowed their delight in the atrocities they
committed.&nbsp; Finally, the first of the two fish was thrown
back into the ocean with a pointed stake thrust into its upper
and lower jaws so that it could not close its mouth.&nbsp;
Inevitable and prolonged starvation was the fate thus meted out
to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you something, boys,&rdquo; Andy Fay
cried, as they prepared to handle the second shark.</p>
<p>The Maltese Cockney had been a most capable master of
ceremonies with the first one.&nbsp; More than anything else, I
think, was I hardened against these brutes by what I saw them
do.&nbsp; In the end, the maltreated fish thrashed about the deck
entirely eviscerated.&nbsp; Nothing remained but the mere
flesh-shell of the creature, yet it would not die.&nbsp; It was
amazing the life that lingered when all the vital organs were
gone.&nbsp; But more amazing things were to follow.</p>
<p>Mulligan Jacobs, his arms a butcher&rsquo;s to the elbows,
without as much as &ldquo;by your leave,&rdquo; suddenly thrust a
hunk of meat into my hand.&nbsp; I sprang back, startled, and
dropped it to the deck, while a gleeful howl went up from the
two-score men.&nbsp; I was shamed, despite myself.&nbsp; These
brutes held me in little respect; and, after all, human nature is
so strange a compound that even a philosopher dislikes being held
in disesteem by the brutes of his own species.</p>
<p>I looked at what I had dropped.&nbsp; It was the heart of the
shark, and as I looked, there under my eyes, on the scorching
deck where the pitch oozed from the seams, the heart pulsed with
life.</p>
<p>And I dared.&nbsp; I would not permit these animals to laugh
at any fastidiousness of mine.&nbsp; I stooped and picked up the
heart, and while I concealed and conquered my qualms I held it in
my hand and felt it beat in my hand.</p>
<p>At any rate, I had won a mild victory over Mulligan Jacobs;
for he abandoned me for the more delectable diversion of
torturing the shark that would not die.&nbsp; For several minutes
it had been lying quite motionless.&nbsp; Mulligan Jacobs smote
it a heavy blow on the nose with the flat of a hatchet, and as
the thing galvanized into life and flung its body about the deck
the little venomous man screamed in ecstasy:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hooks are in it!&mdash;the hooks are in
it!&mdash;and burnin&rsquo; hot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He squirmed and writhed with fiendish delight, and again he
struck it on the nose and made it leap.</p>
<p>This was too much, and I beat a retreat&mdash;feigning
boredom, or cessation of interest, of course; and absently
carrying the still throbbing heart in my hand.</p>
<p>As I came upon the poop I saw Miss West, with her sewing
basket, emerging from the port door of the chart-house.&nbsp; The
deck-chairs were on that side, so I stole around on the starboard
side of the chart-house in order to fling overboard unobserved
the dreadful thing I carried.&nbsp; But, drying on the surface in
the tropic heat and still pulsing inside, it stuck to my hand, so
that it was a bad cast.&nbsp; Instead of clearing the railing, it
struck on the pin-rail and stuck there in the shade, and as I
opened the door to go below and wash my hands, with a last glance
I saw it pulse where it had fallen.</p>
<p>When I came back it was still pulsing.&nbsp; I heard a splash
overside from the waist of the ship, and knew the carcass had
been flung overboard.&nbsp; I did not go around the chart-house
and join Miss West, but stood enthralled by the spectacle of that
heart that beat in the tropic heat.</p>
<p>Boisterous shouts from the sailors attracted my
attention.&nbsp; They had all climbed to the top of the tall rail
and were watching something outboard.&nbsp; I followed their gaze
and saw the amazing thing.&nbsp; That long-eviscerated shark was
not dead.&nbsp; It moved, it swam, it thrashed about, and ever it
strove to escape from the surface of the ocean.&nbsp; Sometimes
it swam down as deep as fifty or a hundred feet, and then, still
struggling to escape the surface, struggled involuntarily to the
surface.&nbsp; Each failure thus to escape fetched wild laughter
from the men.&nbsp; But why did they laugh?&nbsp; The thing was
sublime, horrible, but it was not humorous.&nbsp; I leave it to
you.&nbsp; What is there laughable in the sight of a
pain-distraught fish rolling helplessly on the surface of the sea
and exposing to the sun all its essential emptiness?</p>
<p>I was turning away, when renewed shouting drew my gaze.&nbsp;
Half a dozen other sharks had appeared, smaller ones, nine or ten
feet long.&nbsp; They attacked their helpless comrade.&nbsp; They
tore him to pieces they destroyed him, devoured him.&nbsp; I saw
the last shred of him disappear down their maws.&nbsp; He was
gone, disintegrated, entombed in the living bodies of his kind,
and already entering into the processes of digestion.&nbsp; And
yet, there, in the shade on the pin-rail, that unbelievable and
monstrous heart beat on.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<p>The voyage is doomed to disaster and death.&nbsp; I know Mr.
Pike, now, and if ever he discovers the identity of Mr. Mellaire,
murder will be done.&nbsp; Mr. Mellaire is not Mr.
Mellaire.&nbsp; He is not from Georgia.&nbsp; He is from
Virginia.&nbsp; His name is Waltham&mdash;Sidney Waltham.&nbsp;
He is one of the Walthams of Virginia, a black sheep, true, but a
Waltham.&nbsp; Of this I am convinced, just as utterly as I am
convinced that Mr. Pike will kill him if he learns who he is.</p>
<p>Let me tell how I have discovered all this.&nbsp; It was last
night, shortly before midnight, when I came up on the poop to
enjoy a whiff of the south-east trades in which we are now
bowling along, close-hauled in order to weather Cape San
Roque.&nbsp; Mr. Pike had the watch, and I paced up and down with
him while he told me old pages of his life.&nbsp; He has often
done this, when not &ldquo;sea-grouched,&rdquo; and often he has
mentioned with pride&mdash;yes, with reverence&mdash;a master
with whom he sailed five years.&nbsp; &ldquo;Old Captain
Somers,&rdquo; he called him&mdash;&ldquo;the finest, squarest,
noblest man I ever sailed under, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, last night our talk turned on lugubrious subjects, and
Mr. Pike, wicked old man that he is, descanted on the wickedness
of the world and on the wickedness of the man who had murdered
Captain Somers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was an old man, over seventy years old,&rdquo; Mr.
Pike went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;And they say he&rsquo;d got a touch of
palsy&mdash;I hadn&rsquo;t seen him for years.&nbsp; You see,
I&rsquo;d had to clear out from the coast because of
trouble.&nbsp; And that devil of a second mate caught him in bed
late at night and beat him to death.&nbsp; It was terrible.&nbsp;
They told me about it.&nbsp; Right in San Francisco, on board the
<i>Jason Harrison</i>, it happened, eleven years ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you know what they did?&nbsp; First, they gave
the murderer life, when he should have been hanged.&nbsp; His
plea was insanity, from having had his head chopped open a long
time before by a crazy sea-cook.&nbsp; And when he&rsquo;d served
seven years the governor pardoned him.&nbsp; He wasn&rsquo;t any
good, but his people were a powerful old Virginian family, the
Walthams&mdash;I guess you&rsquo;ve heard of them&mdash;and they
brought all kinds of pressure to bear.&nbsp; His name was Sidney
Waltham.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment the warning bell, a single stroke fifteen
minutes before the change of watch, rang out from the wheel and
was repeated by the look-out on the forecastle head.&nbsp; Mr.
Pike, under his stress of feeling, had stopped walking, and we
stood at the break of the poop.&nbsp; As chance would have it,
Mr. Mellaire was a quarter of an hour ahead of time, and he
climbed the poop-ladder and stood beside us while the mate
concluded his tale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mind it,&rdquo; Mr. Pike continued,
&ldquo;as long as he&rsquo;d got life and was serving his
time.&nbsp; But when they pardoned him out after only seven years
I swore I&rsquo;d get him.&nbsp; And I will.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
believe in God or devil, and it&rsquo;s a rotten crazy world
anyway; but I do believe in hunches.&nbsp; And I know I&rsquo;m
going to get him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will you do?&rdquo; I queried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do?&rdquo; Mr. Pike&rsquo;s voice was fraught with
surprise that I should not know.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do?&nbsp; Well,
what did he do to old Captain Somers?&nbsp; Yet he&rsquo;s
disappeared these last three years now.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve heard
neither hide nor hair of him.&nbsp; But he&rsquo;s a sailor, and
he&rsquo;ll drift back to the sea, and some day . . . &rdquo;</p>
<p>In the illumination of a match with which the second mate was
lighting his pipe I saw Mr. Pike&rsquo;s gorilla arms and huge
clenched paws raised to heaven, and his face convulsed and
working.&nbsp; Also, in that brief moment of light, I saw that
the second mate&rsquo;s hand which held the match was
shaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I ain&rsquo;t never seen even a photo of
him,&rdquo; Mr. Pike added.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve got a
general idea of his looks, and he&rsquo;s got a mark
unmistakable.&nbsp; I could know him by it in the dark.&nbsp; All
I&rsquo;d have to do is feel it.&nbsp; Some day I&rsquo;ll stick
my fingers into that mark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you say, sir, was the captain&rsquo;s
name?&rdquo; Mr. Mellaire asked casually.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somers&mdash;old Captain Somers,&rdquo; Mr. Pike
answered.</p>
<p>Mr. Mellaire repeated the name aloud several times, and then
hazarded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t he command the <i>Lammermoor</i> thirty
years ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I recognized him.&nbsp; I lay at anchor in a
ship next to his in Table Bay that time ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the wickedness of the world, the wickedness of the
world,&rdquo; Mr. Pike muttered as he turned and strode away.</p>
<p>I said good-night to the second mate and had started to go
below, when he called to me in a low voice, &ldquo;Mr.
Pathurst!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I stopped, and then he said, hurriedly and confusedly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, sir . . . I beg your pardon . . . I&mdash;I
changed my mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Below, lying in my bunk, I found myself unable to read.&nbsp;
My mind was bent on returning to what had just occurred on deck,
and, against my will, the most gruesome speculations kept
suggesting themselves.</p>
<p>And then came Mr. Mellaire.&nbsp; He had slipped down the
booby hatch into the big after-room and thence through the
hallway to my room.&nbsp; He entered noiselessly, on clumsy
tiptoes, and pressed his finger warningly to his lips.&nbsp; Not
until he was beside my bunk did he speak, and then it was in a
whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir, Mr. Pathurst . . . I&mdash;I
beg your pardon; but, you see, sir, I was just passing, and
seeing you awake I . . . I thought it would not inconvenience you
to . . . you see, I thought I might just as well prefer a small
favour . . . seeing that I would not inconvenience you, sir . . .
I . . . I . . . &rdquo;</p>
<p>I waited for him to proceed, and in the pause that ensued,
while he licked his dry lips with his tongue, the thing ambushed
in his skull peered at me through his eyes and seemed almost on
the verge of leaping out and pouncing upon me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; he began again, this time more
coherently, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s just a little thing&mdash;foolish
on my part, of course&mdash;a whim, so to say&mdash;but you will
remember, near the beginning of the voyage, I showed you a scar
on my head . . . a really small affair, sir, which I contracted
in a misadventure.&nbsp; It amounts to a deformity, which it is
my fancy to conceal.&nbsp; Not for worlds, sir, would I care to
have Miss West, for instance, know that I carried such a
deformity.&nbsp; A man is a man, sir&mdash;you
understand&mdash;and you have not spoken of it to her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;It just happens that
I have not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor to anybody else?&mdash;to, say, Captain
West?&mdash;or, say, Mr. Pike?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t mentioned it to anybody,&rdquo; I
averred.</p>
<p>He could not conceal the relief he experienced.&nbsp; The
perturbation went out of his face and manner, and the ambushed
thing drew back deeper into the recess of his skull.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The favour, sir, Mr. Pathurst, that I would prefer is
that you will not mention that little matter to anybody.&nbsp; I
suppose&rdquo; (he smiled, and his voice was superlatively suave)
&ldquo;it is vanity on my part&mdash;you understand, I am
sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I nodded, and made a restless movement with my book as
evidence that I desired to resume my reading.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can depend upon you for that, Mr.
Pathurst?&rdquo;&nbsp; His whole voice and manner had
changed.&nbsp; It was practically a command, and I could almost
see fangs, bared and menacing, sprouting in the jaws of that
thing I fancied dwelt behind his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; I answered coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir&mdash;I thank you,&rdquo; he said, and,
without more ado, tiptoed from the room.</p>
<p>Of course I did not read.&nbsp; How could I?&nbsp; Nor did I
sleep.&nbsp; My mind ran on, and on, and not until the steward
brought my coffee, shortly before five, did I sink into my first
doze.</p>
<p>One thing is very evident.&nbsp; Mr. Pike does not dream that
the murderer of Captain Somers is on board the
<i>Elsinore</i>.&nbsp; He has never glimpsed that prodigious
fissure that clefts Mr. Mellaire&rsquo;s, or, rather, Sidney
Waltham&rsquo;s, skull.&nbsp; And I, for one, shall never tell
Mr. Pike.&nbsp; And I know, now, why from the very first I
disliked the second mate.&nbsp; And I understand that live thing,
that other thing, that lurks within and peers out through the
eyes.&nbsp; I have recognized the same thing in the three
gangsters for&rsquo;ard.&nbsp; Like the second mate, they are
prison birds.&nbsp; The restraint, the secrecy, and iron control
of prison life has developed in all of them terrible other
selves.</p>
<p>Yes, and another thing is very evident.&nbsp; On board this
ship, driving now through the South Atlantic for the winter
passage of Cape Horn, are all the elements of sea tragedy and
horror.&nbsp; We are freighted with human dynamite that is liable
at any moment to blow our tiny floating world to fragments.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<p>The days slip by.&nbsp; The south-east trade is brisk and
small splashes of sea occasionally invade my open ports.&nbsp;
Mr. Pike&rsquo;s room was soaked yesterday.&nbsp; This is the
most exciting thing that has happened for some time.&nbsp; The
gangsters rule in the forecastle.&nbsp; Larry and Shorty have had
a harmless <i>fight</i>.&nbsp; The hooks continue to burn in
Mulligan Jacobs&rsquo;s brain.&nbsp; Charles Davis resides alone
in his little steel room, coming out only to get his food from
the galley.&nbsp; Miss West plays and sings, doctors Possum,
launders, and is for ever otherwise busy with her fancy
work.&nbsp; Mr. Pike runs the phonograph every other evening in
the second dog-watch.&nbsp; Mr. Mellaire hides the cleft in his
head.&nbsp; I keep his secret.&nbsp; And Captain West, more
remote than ever, sits in the draught of wind in the twilight
cabin.</p>
<p>We are now thirty-seven days at sea, in which time, until
to-day, we have not sighted a vessel.&nbsp; And to-day, at one
time, no less than six vessels were visible from the deck.&nbsp;
Not until I saw these ships was I able thoroughly to realize how
lonely this ocean is.</p>
<p>Mr. Pike tells me we are several hundred miles off the South
American coast.&nbsp; And yet, only the other day, it seems, we
were scarcely more distant from Africa.&nbsp; A big velvety moth
fluttered aboard this morning, and we are filled with
conjecture.&nbsp; How possibly could it have come from the South
American coast these hundreds of miles in the teeth of the
trades?</p>
<p>The Southern Cross has been visible, of course, for weeks; the
North Star has disappeared behind the bulge of the earth; and the
Great Bear, at its highest, is very low.&nbsp; Soon it, too, will
be gone and we shall be raising the Magellan Clouds.</p>
<p>I remember the fight between Larry and Shorty.&nbsp; Wada
reports that Mr. Pike watched it for some time, until, becoming
incensed at their awkwardness, he clouted both of them with his
open hands and made them stop, announcing that until they could
make a better showing he intended doing all the fighting on the
<i>Elsinore</i> himself.</p>
<p>It is a feat beyond me to realize that he is sixty-nine years
old.&nbsp; And when I look at the tremendous build of him and at
his fearful, man-handling hands, I conjure up a vision of him
avenging Captain Somers&rsquo;s murder.</p>
<p>Life is cruel.&nbsp; Amongst the <i>Elsinore&rsquo;s</i> five
thousand tons of coal are thousands of rats.&nbsp; There is no
way for them to get out of their steel-walled prison, for all the
ventilators are guarded with stout wire-mesh.&nbsp; On her
previous voyage, loaded with barley, they increased and
multiplied.&nbsp; Now they are imprisoned in the coal, and
cannibalism is what must occur among them.&nbsp; Mr. Pike says
that when we reach Seattle there will be a dozen or a score of
survivors, huge fellows, the strongest and fiercest.&nbsp;
Sometimes, passing the mouth of one ventilator that is in the
after wall of the chart-house, I can hear their plaintive
squealing and crying from far beneath in the coal.</p>
<p>Other and luckier rats are in the &rsquo;tween decks
for&rsquo;ard, where all the spare suits of sails are
stored.&nbsp; They come out and run about the deck at night,
steal food from the galley, and lap up the dew.&nbsp; Which
reminds me that Mr. Pike will no longer look at Possum.&nbsp; It
seems, under his suggestion, that Wada trapped a rat in the
donkey-engine room.&nbsp; Wada swears that it was the father of
all rats, and that, by actual measurement, it scaled eighteen
inches from nose to the tip of tail.&nbsp; Also, it seems that
Mr. Pike and Wada, with the door shut in the former&rsquo;s room,
pitted the rat against Possum, and that Possum was licked.&nbsp;
They were compelled to kill the rat themselves, while Possum,
when all was over, lay down and had a fit.</p>
<p>Now Mr. Pike abhors a coward, and his disgust with Possum is
profound.&nbsp; He no longer plays with the puppy, nor even
speaks to him, and, whenever he passes him on the deck, glowers
sourly at him.</p>
<p>I have been reading up the South Atlantic Sailing Directions,
and I find that we are now entering the most beautiful sunset
region in the world.&nbsp; And this evening we were favoured with
a sample.&nbsp; I was in my quarters, overhauling my books, when
Miss West called to me from the foot of the chart-house
stairs:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Pathurst!&mdash;Come quick!&nbsp; Oh, do come
quick!&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t afford to miss it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Half the sky, from the zenith to the western sea-line, was an
astonishing sheet of pure, pale, even gold.&nbsp; And through
this sheen, on the horizon, burned the sun, a disc of richer
gold.&nbsp; The gold of the sky grew more golden, then tarnished
before our eyes and began to glow faintly with red.&nbsp; As the
red deepened, a mist spread over the whole sheet of gold and the
burning yellow sun.&nbsp; Turner was never guilty of so audacious
an orgy in gold-mist.</p>
<p>Presently, along the horizon, entirely completing the circle
of sea and sky, the tight-packed shapes of the trade wind clouds
began to show through the mist; and as they took form they
spilled with rose-colour at their upper edges, while their bases
were a pulsing, bluish-white.&nbsp; I say it advisedly.&nbsp; All
the colours of this display <i>pulsed</i>.</p>
<p>As the gold-mist continued to clear away, the colours became
garish, bold; the turquoises went into greens and the roses
turned to the red of blood.&nbsp; And the purple and indigo of
the long swells of sea were bronzed with the colour-riot in the
sky, while across the water, like gigantic serpents, crawled red
and green sky-reflections.&nbsp; And then all the gorgeousness
quickly dulled, and the warm, tropic darkness drew about us.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<p>The <i>Elsinore</i> is truly the ship of souls, the world in
miniature; and, because she is such a small world, cleaving this
vastitude of ocean as our larger world cleaves space, the strange
juxtapositions that continually occur are startling.</p>
<p>For instance, this afternoon on the poop.&nbsp; Let me
describe it.&nbsp; Here was Miss West, in a crisp duck sailor
suit, immaculately white, open at the throat, where, under the
broad collar, was knotted a man-of-war black silk
neckerchief.&nbsp; Her smooth-groomed hair, a trifle rebellious
in the breeze, was glorious.&nbsp; And here was I, in white
ducks, white shoes, and white silk shirt, as immaculate and
well-tended as she.&nbsp; The steward was just bringing the
pretty tea-service for Miss West, and in the background Wada
hovered.</p>
<p>We had been discussing philosophy&mdash;or, rather, I had been
feeling her out; and from a sketch of Spinoza&rsquo;s
anticipations of the modern mind, through the speculative
interpretations of the latest achievements in physics of Sir
Oliver Lodge and Sir William Ramsay, I had come, as usual, to De
Casseres, whom I was quoting, when Mr. Pike snarled orders to the
watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;In this rise into the azure of pure perception,
attainable only by a very few human beings, the spectacular sense
is born,&rsquo;.&rdquo;&nbsp; I was quoting.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Life is no longer good or evil.&nbsp; It is a
perpetual play of forces without beginning or end.&nbsp; The
freed Intellect merges itself with the World-Will and partakes of
its essence, which is not a moral essence but an &aelig;sthetic
essence . . . &rdquo;</p>
<p>And at this moment the watch swarmed on to the poop to haul on
the port-braces of the mizzen-sky-sail, royal and
topgallant-sail.&nbsp; The sailors passed us, or toiled close to
us, with lowered eyes.&nbsp; They did not look at us, so far
removed from them were we.&nbsp; It was this contrast that caught
my fancy.&nbsp; Here were the high and low, slaves and masters,
beauty and ugliness, cleanness and filth.&nbsp; Their feet were
bare and scaled with patches of tar and pitch.&nbsp; Their
unbathed bodies were garmented in the meanest of clothes, dingy,
dirty, ragged, and sparse.&nbsp; Each one had on but two
garments&mdash;dungaree trousers and a shoddy cotton shirt.</p>
<p>And we, in our comfortable deck-chairs, our two servants at
our backs, the quintessence of elegant leisure, sipped delicate
tea from beautiful, fragile cups, and looked on at these wretched
ones whose labour made possible the journey of our little
world.&nbsp; We did not speak to them, nor recognize their
existence, any more than would they have dared speak to us.</p>
<p>And Miss West, with the appraising eye of a plantation
mistress for the condition of her field slaves, looked them
over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see how they have fleshed up,&rdquo; she said, as
they coiled the last turns of the ropes over the pins and faded
away for&rsquo;ard off the poop.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is the regular
hours, the good weather, the hard work, the open air, the
sufficient food, and the absence of whisky.&nbsp; And they will
keep in this fettle until they get off the Horn.&nbsp; And then
you will see them go down from day to day.&nbsp; A winter passage
of the Horn is always a severe strain on the men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then, once we are around and in the good weather of
the Pacific, you will see them gain again from day to day.&nbsp;
And when we reach Seattle they will be in splendid shape.&nbsp;
Only they will go ashore, drink up their wages in several days,
and ship away on other vessels in precisely the same sodden,
miserable condition that they were in when they sailed with us
from Baltimore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And just then Captain West came out the chart-house door,
strolled by for a single turn up and down, and with a smile and a
word for us and an all-observant eye for the ship, the trim of
her sails, the wind, and the sky, and the weather promise, went
back through the chart-house door&mdash;the blond Aryan master,
the king, the Samurai.</p>
<p>And I finished sipping my tea of delicious and most expensive
aroma, and our slant-eyed, dark-skinned servitors carried the
pretty gear away, and I read, continuing De Casseres:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Instinct wills, creates, carries on the work of
the species.&nbsp; The Intellect destroys, negatives, satirizes
and ends in pure nihilism, instinct creates life, endlessly,
hurling forth profusely and blindly its clowns, tragedians and
comedians.&nbsp; Intellect remains the eternal spectator of the
play.&nbsp; It participates at will, but never gives itself
wholly to the fine sport.&nbsp; The Intellect, freed from the
trammels of the personal will, soars into the ether of
perception, where Instinct follows it in a thousand disguises,
seeking to draw it down to earth.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<p>We are now south of Rio and working south.&nbsp; We are out of
the latitude of the trades, and the wind is capricious.&nbsp;
Rain squalls and wind squalls vex the <i>Elsinore</i>.&nbsp; One
hour we may be rolling sickeningly in a dead calm, and the next
hour we may be dashing fourteen knots through the water and
taking off sail as fast as the men can clew up and lower
away.&nbsp; A night of calm, when sleep is well-nigh impossible
in the sultry, muggy air, may be followed by a day of blazing sun
and an oily swell from the south&rsquo;ard, connoting great gales
in that area of ocean we are sailing toward&mdash;or all day long
the <i>Elsinore</i>, under an overcast sky, royals and sky sails
furled, may plunge and buck under wind-pressure into a short and
choppy head-sea.</p>
<p>And all this means work for the men.&nbsp; Taking Mr.
Pike&rsquo;s judgment, they are very inadequate, though by this
time they know the ropes.&nbsp; He growls and grumbles, and
snorts and sneers whenever he watches them doing anything.&nbsp;
To-day, at eleven in the morning, the wind was so violent,
continuing in greater gusts after having come in a great gust,
that Mr. Pike ordered the mainsail taken off.&nbsp; The great
crojack was already off.&nbsp; But the watch could not clew up
the mainsail, and, after much vain sing-songing and pull-hauling,
the watch below was routed out to bear a hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; Mr. Pike groaned to me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Two
watches for a rag like that when half a decent watch could do
it!&nbsp; Look at that preventer bosun of mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor Nancy!&nbsp; He looked the saddest, sickest, bleakest
creature I had ever seen.&nbsp; He was so wretched, so miserable,
so helpless.&nbsp; And Sundry Buyers was just as impotent.&nbsp;
The expression on his face was of pain and hopelessness, and as
he pressed his abdomen he lumbered futilely about, ever seeking
something he might do and ever failing to find it.&nbsp; He
pottered.&nbsp; He would stand and stare at one rope for a minute
or so at a time, following it aloft with his eyes through the
maze of ropes and stabs and gears with all the intentness of a
man working out an intricate problem.&nbsp; Then, holding his
hand against his stomach, he would lumber on a few steps and
select another rope for study.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear, oh dear,&rdquo; Mr. Pike lamented.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How can one drive with bosuns like that and a crew like
that?&nbsp; Just the same, if I was captain of this ship
I&rsquo;d drive &rsquo;em.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d show &rsquo;em what
drive was, if I had to lose a few of them.&nbsp; And when they
grow weak off the Horn what&rsquo;ll we do?&nbsp; It&rsquo;ll be
both watches all the time, which will weaken them just that much
the faster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Evidently this winter passage of the Horn is all that one has
been led to expect from reading the narratives of the
navigators.&nbsp; Iron men like the two mates are very respectful
of &ldquo;Cape Stiff,&rdquo; as they call that uttermost tip of
the American continent.&nbsp; Speaking of the two mates,
iron-made and iron-mouthed that they are, it is amusing that in
really serious moments both of them curse with &ldquo;Oh dear, oh
dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the spells of calm I take great delight in the little
rifle.&nbsp; I have already fired away five thousand rounds, and
have come to consider myself an expert.&nbsp; Whatever the knack
of shooting may be, I&rsquo;ve got it.&nbsp; When I get back I
shall take up target practice.&nbsp; It is a neat, deft
sport.</p>
<p>Not only is Possum afraid of the sails and of rats, but he is
afraid of rifle-fire, and at the first discharge goes yelping and
ki-yi-ing below.&nbsp; The dislike Mr. Pike has developed for the
poor little puppy is ludicrous.&nbsp; He even told me that if it
were his dog he&rsquo;d throw it overboard for a target.&nbsp;
Just the same, he is an affectionate, heart-warming little
rascal, and has already crept so deep into my heart that I am
glad Miss West did not accept him.</p>
<p>And&mdash;oh!&mdash;he insists on sleeping with me on top the
bedding; a proceeding which has scandalized the mate.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I suppose he&rsquo;ll be using your toothbrush
next,&rdquo; Mr. Pike growled at me.&nbsp; But the puppy loves my
companionship, and is never happier than when on the bed with
me.&nbsp; Yet the bed is not entirely paradise, for Possum is
badly frightened when ours is the lee side and the seas pound and
smash against the glass ports.&nbsp; Then the little beggar,
electric with fear to every hair tip, crouches and snarls
menacingly and almost at the same time whimpers appeasingly at
the storm-monster outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father <i>knows</i> the sea,&rdquo; Miss West said to
me this afternoon.&nbsp; &ldquo;He understands it, and he loves
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or it may be habit,&rdquo; I ventured.</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He does know it.&nbsp; And he loves it.&nbsp; That is
why he has come back to it.&nbsp; All his people before him were
sea folk.&nbsp; His grandfather, Anthony West, made forty-six
voyages between 1801 and 1847.&nbsp; And his father, Robert,
sailed master to the north-west coast before the gold days and
was captain of some of the fastest Cape Horn clippers after the
gold discovery.&nbsp; Elijah West, father&rsquo;s
great-grandfather, was a privateersman in the Revolution.&nbsp;
He commanded the armed brig <i>New Defence</i>.&nbsp; And, even
before that, Elijah&rsquo;s father, in turn, and Elijah&rsquo;s
father&rsquo;s father, were masters and owners on long-voyage
merchant adventures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anthony West, in 1813 and 1814, commanded the <i>David
Bruce</i>, with letters of marque.&nbsp; He was half-owner, with
Gracie &amp; Sons as the other half-owners.&nbsp; She was a
two-hundred-ton schooner, built right up in Maine.&nbsp; She
carried a long eighteen-pounder, two ten-pounders, and ten
six-pounders, and she sailed like a witch.&nbsp; She ran the
blockade off Newport and got away to the English Channel and the
Bay of Biscay.&nbsp; And, do you know, though she only cost
twelve thousand dollars all told, she took over three hundred
thousand dollars of British prizes.&nbsp; A brother of his was on
the <i>Wasp</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, you see, the sea is in our blood.&nbsp; She is our
mother.&nbsp; As far back as we can trace all our line was born
to the sea.&rdquo;&nbsp; She laughed and went on.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve pirates and slavers in our family, and all
sorts of disreputable sea-rovers.&nbsp; Old Ezra West, just how
far back I don&rsquo;t remember, was executed for piracy and his
body hung in chains at Plymouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sea is father&rsquo;s blood.&nbsp; And he knows,
well, a ship, as you would know a dog or a horse.&nbsp; Every
ship he sails has a distinct personality for him.&nbsp; I have
watched him, in high moments, and <i>seen</i> him think.&nbsp;
But oh! the times I have seen him when he does not
think&mdash;when he <i>feels</i> and knows everything without
thinking at all.&nbsp; Really, with all that appertains to the
sea and ships, he is an artist.&nbsp; There is no other word for
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think a great deal of your father,&rdquo; I
remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is the most wonderful man I have ever known,&rdquo;
she replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;Remember, you are not seeing him at his
best.&nbsp; He has never been the same since mother&rsquo;s
death.&nbsp; If ever a man and woman were one, they
were.&rdquo;&nbsp; She broke off, then concluded abruptly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know him.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t know him
at all.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I think we are going to have a fine sunset,&rdquo;
Captain West remarked last evening.</p>
<p>Miss West and I abandoned our rubber of cribbage and hastened
on deck.&nbsp; The sunset had not yet come, but all was
preparing.&nbsp; As we gazed we could see the sky gathering the
materials, grouping the gray clouds in long lines and towering
masses, spreading its palette with slow-growing, glowing tints
and sudden blobs of colour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Golden Gate!&rdquo; Miss West cried,
indicating the west.&nbsp; &ldquo;See!&nbsp; We&rsquo;re just
inside the harbour.&nbsp; Look to the south there.&nbsp; If that
isn&rsquo;t the sky-line of San Francisco!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
the Call Building, and there, far down, the Ferry Tower, and
surely that is the Fairmount.&rdquo;&nbsp; Her eyes roved back
through the opening between the cloud masses, and she clapped her
hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sunset within a sunset!&nbsp;
See!&nbsp; The Farallones!&rdquo;&mdash;swimming in a miniature
orange and red sunset all their own.&nbsp; &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it
the Golden Gate, and San Francisco, and the
Farallones?&rdquo;&nbsp; She appealed to Mr. Pike, who, leaning
near, on the poop-rail, was divided between gazing sourly at
Nancy pottering on the main deck and sourly at Possum, who, on
the bridge, crouched with terror each time the crojack flapped
emptily above him.</p>
<p>The mate turned his head and favoured the sky picture with a
solemn stare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he growled.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It may look like the Farallones to you, but to me it looks
like a battleship coming right in the Gate with a bone in its
teeth at a twenty-knot clip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sure enough.&nbsp; The floating Farallones had metamorphosed
into a giant warship.</p>
<p>Then came the colour riot, the dominant tone of which was
green.&nbsp; It was green, green, green&mdash;the blue-green of
the springing year, and sere and yellow green and tawny-brown
green of autumn.&nbsp; There were orange green, gold green, and a
copper green.&nbsp; And all these greens were rich green beyond
description; and yet the richness and the greenness passed even
as we gazed upon it, going out of the gray clouds and into the
sea, which assumed the exquisite golden pink of polished copper,
while the hollows of the smooth and silken ripples were touched
by a most ethereal pea green.</p>
<p>The gray clouds became a long, low swathe of ruby red, or
garnet red&mdash;such as one sees in a glass of heavy burgundy
when held to the light.&nbsp; There was such depth to this
red!&nbsp; And, below it, separated from the main colour-mass by
a line of gray-white fog, or line of sea, was another and smaller
streak of ruddy-coloured wine.</p>
<p>I strolled across the poop to the port side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; Come back!&nbsp; Look!&nbsp; Look!&rdquo;
Miss West cried to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use?&rdquo; I answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve something just as good over here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She joined me, and as she did so I noted, a sour grin on Mr.
Pike&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>The eastern heavens were equally spectacular.&nbsp; That
quarter of the sky was sheer and delicate shell of blue, the
upper portions of which faded, changed, through every harmony,
into a pale, yet warm, rose, all trembling, palpitating, with
misty blue tinting into pink.&nbsp; The reflection of this
coloured sky-shell upon the water made of the sea a glimmering
watered silk, all changeable, blue, Nile-green, and
salmon-pink.&nbsp; It was silky, silken, a wonderful silk that
veneered and flossed the softly moving, wavy water.</p>
<p>And the pale moon looked like a wet pearl gleaming through the
tinted mist of the sky-shell.</p>
<p>In the southern quadrant of the sky we discovered an entirely
different sunset&mdash;what would be accounted a very excellent
orange-and-red sunset anywhere, with grey clouds hanging low and
lighted and tinted on all their under edges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; Mr. Pike muttered gruffly, while we were
exclaiming over our fresh discovery.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look at the
sunset I got here to the north.&nbsp; It ain&rsquo;t doing so
badly now, I leave it to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And it wasn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; The northern quadrant was a great
fen of colour and cloud, that spread ribs of feathery pink,
fleece-frilled, from the horizon to the zenith.&nbsp; It was all
amazing.&nbsp; Four sunsets at the one time in the sky!&nbsp;
Each quadrant glowed, and burned, and pulsed with a sunset
distinctly its own.</p>
<p>And as the colours dulled in the slow twilight, the moon,
still misty, wept tears of brilliant, heavy silver into the dim
lilac sea.&nbsp; And then came the hush of darkness and the
night, and we came to ourselves, out of reverie, sated with
beauty, leaning toward each other as we leaned upon the rail side
by side.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>I never grow tired of watching Captain West.&nbsp; In a way he
bears a sort of resemblance to several of Washington&rsquo;s
portraits.&nbsp; He is six feet of aristocratic thinness, and has
a very definite, leisurely and stately grace of movement.&nbsp;
His thinness is almost ascetic.&nbsp; In appearance and manner he
is the perfect old-type New England gentleman.</p>
<p>He has the same gray eyes as his daughter, although his are
genial rather than warm; and his eyes have the same trick of
smiling.&nbsp; His skin is pinker than hers, and his brows and
lashes are fairer.&nbsp; But he seems removed beyond passion, or
even simple enthusiasm.&nbsp; Miss West is firm, like her father;
but there is warmth in her firmness.&nbsp; He is clean, he is
sweet and courteous; but he is coolly sweet, coolly
courteous.&nbsp; With all his certain graciousness, in cabin or
on deck, so far as his social equals are concerned, his
graciousness is cool, elevated, thin.</p>
<p>He is the perfect master of the art of doing nothing.&nbsp; He
never reads, except the Bible; yet he is never bored.&nbsp;
Often, I note him in a deck-chair, studying his perfect
finger-nails, and, I&rsquo;ll swear, not seeing them at
all.&nbsp; Miss West says he loves the sea.&nbsp; And I ask
myself a thousand times, &ldquo;But how?&rdquo; He shows no
interest in any phase of the sea.&nbsp; Although he called our
attention to the glorious sunset I have just described, he did
not remain on deck to enjoy it.&nbsp; He sat below, in the big
leather chair, not reading, not dozing, but merely gazing
straight before him at nothing.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>The days pass, and the seasons pass.&nbsp; We left Baltimore
at the tail-end of winter, went into spring and on through
summer, and now we are in fall weather and urging our way south
to the winter of Cape Horn.&nbsp; And as we double the Cape and
proceed north, we shall go through spring and summer&mdash;a long
summer&mdash;pursuing the sun north through its declination and
arriving at Seattle in summer.&nbsp; And all these seasons have
occurred, and will have occurred, in the space of five
months.</p>
<p>Our white ducks are gone, and, in south latitude thirty-five,
we are wearing the garments of a temperate clime.&nbsp; I notice
that Wada has given me heavier underclothes and heavier pyjamas,
and that Possum, of nights, is no longer content with the top of
the bed but must crawl underneath the bed-clothes.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>We are now off the Plate, a region notorious for storms, and
Mr. Pike is on the lookout for a pampero.&nbsp; Captain West does
not seem to be on the lookout for anything; yet I notice that he
spends longer hours on deck when the sky and barometer are
threatening.</p>
<p>Yesterday we had a hint of Plate weather, and to-day an
awesome fiasco of the same.&nbsp; The hint came last evening
between the twilight and the dark.&nbsp; There was practically no
wind, and the <i>Elsinore</i>, just maintaining steerage way by
means of intermittent fans of air from the north, floundered
exasperatingly in a huge glassy swell that rolled up as an echo
from some blown-out storm to the south.</p>
<p>Ahead of us, arising with the swiftness of magic, was a dense
slate-blackness.&nbsp; I suppose it was cloud-formation, but it
bore no semblance to clouds.&nbsp; It was merely and sheerly a
blackness that towered higher and higher until it overhung us,
while it spread to right and left, blotting out half the sea.</p>
<p>And still the light puffs from the north filled our sails; and
still, as the <i>Elsinore</i> floundered on the huge, smooth
swells and the sails emptied and flapped a hollow thunder, we
moved slowly towards that ominous blackness.&nbsp; In the cast,
in what was quite distinctly an active thunder cloud, the
lightning fairly winked, while the blackness in front of us was
rent with blobs and flashes of lightning.</p>
<p>The last puffs left us, and in the hushes, between the rumbles
of the nearing thunder, the voices of the men aloft on the yards
came to one&rsquo;s ear as if they were right beside one instead
of being hundreds of feet away and up in the air.&nbsp; That they
were duly impressed by what was impending was patent from the
earnestness with which they worked.&nbsp; Both watches toiled
under both mates, and Captain West strolled the poop in his usual
casual way, and gave no orders at all, save in low conventional
tones, when Mr. Pike came upon the poop and conferred with
him.</p>
<p>Miss West, having deserted the scene five minutes before,
returned, a proper sea-woman, clad in oil-skins,
sou&rsquo;wester, and long sea-boots.&nbsp; She ordered me, quite
peremptorily, to do the same.&nbsp; But I could not bring myself
to leave the deck for fear of missing something, so I compromised
by having Wada bring my storm-gear to me.</p>
<p>And then the wind came, smack out of the blackness, with the
abruptness of thunder and accompanied by the most diabolical
thunder.&nbsp; And with the rain and thunder came the
blackness.&nbsp; It was tangible.&nbsp; It drove past us in the
bellowing wind like so much stuff that one could feel.&nbsp;
Blackness as well as wind impacted on us.&nbsp; There is no other
way to describe it than by the old, ancient old, way of saying
one could not see his hand before his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it splendid!&rdquo; Miss West shouted into
my ear, close beside me, as we clung to the railing of the break
of the poop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Superb!&rdquo; I shouted back, my lips to her ear, so
that her hair tickled my face.</p>
<p>And, I know not why&mdash;it must have been spontaneous with
both of us&mdash;in that shouting blackness of wind, as we clung
to the rail to avoid being blown away, our hands went out to each
other and my hand and hers gripped and pressed and then held
mutually to the rail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daughter of Herodias,&rdquo; I commented grimly to
myself; but my hand did not leave hers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is happening?&rdquo; I shouted in her ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve lost way,&rdquo; came her answer.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re caught aback!&nbsp; The wheel&rsquo;s
up, but she could not steer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Gabriel voice of the Samurai rang out.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hard
over?&rdquo; was his mellow storm-call to the man at the
wheel.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hard over, sir,&rdquo; came the
helmsman&rsquo;s reply, vague, cracked with strain, and
smothered.</p>
<p>Came the lightning, before us, behind us, on every side,
bathing us in flaming minutes at a time.&nbsp; And all the while
we were deafened by the unceasing uproar of thunder.&nbsp; It was
a weird sight&mdash;far aloft the black skeleton of spars and
masts from which the sails had been removed; lower down, the
sailors clinging like monstrous bugs as they passed the gaskets
and furled; beneath them the few set sails, filled backward
against the masts, gleaming whitely, wickedly, evilly, in the
fearful illumination; and, at the bottom, the deck and bridge and
houses of the <i>Elsinore</i>, and a tangled riff-raff of flying
ropes, and clumps and bunches of swaying, pulling, hauling, human
creatures.</p>
<p>It was a great moment, the master&rsquo;s moment&mdash;caught
all aback with all our bulk and tonnage and infinitude of gear,
and our heaven-aspiring masts two hundred feet above our
heads.&nbsp; And our master was there, in sheeting flame,
slender, casual, imperturbable, with two men&mdash;one of them a
murderer&mdash;under him to pass on and enforce his will, and
with a horde of inefficients and weaklings to obey that will, and
pull, and haul, and by the sheer leverages of physics manipulate
our floating world so that it would endure this fury of the
elements.</p>
<p>What happened next, what was done, I do not know, save that
now and again I heard the Gabriel voice; for the darkness came,
and the rain in pouring, horizontal sheets.&nbsp; It filled my
mouth and strangled my lungs as if I had fallen overboard.&nbsp;
It seemed to drive up as well as down, piercing its way under my
sou&rsquo;wester, through my oilskins, down my tight-buttoned
collar, and into my sea-boots.&nbsp; I was dizzied, obfuscated,
by all this onslaught of thunder, lightning, wind, blackness, and
water.&nbsp; And yet the master, near to me, there on the poop,
lived and moved serenely in all, voicing his wisdom and will to
the wisps of creatures who obeyed and by their brute, puny
strength pulled braces, slacked sheets, dragged courses, swung
yards and lowered them, hauled on buntlines and clewlines,
smoothed and gasketed the huge spreads of canvas.</p>
<p>How it happened I know not, but Miss West and I crouched
together, clinging to the rail and to each other in the shelter
of the thrumming weather-cloth.&nbsp; My arm was about her and
fast to the railing; her shoulder pressed close against me, and
by one hand she held tightly to the lapel of my oilskin.</p>
<p>An hour later we made our way across the poop to the
chart-house, helping each other to maintain footing as the
<i>Elsinore</i> plunged and bucked in the rising sea and was
pressed over and down by the weight of wind on her few remaining
set sails.&nbsp; The wind, which had lulled after the rain, had
risen in recurrent gusts to storm violence.&nbsp; But all was
well with the gallant ship.&nbsp; The crisis was past, and the
ship lived, and we lived, and with streaming faces and bright
eyes we looked at each other and laughed in the bright light of
the chart-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who can blame one for loving the sea?&rdquo; Miss West
cried out exultantly, as she wrung the rain from her ropes of
hair which had gone adrift in the turmoil.&nbsp; &ldquo;And the
men of the sea!&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;The masters of the
sea!&nbsp; You saw my father . . . &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a king,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a king,&rdquo; she repeated after me.</p>
<p>And the <i>Elsinore</i> lifted on a cresting sea and flung
down on her side, so that we were thrown together and brought up
breathless against the wall.</p>
<p>I said good-night to her at the foot of the stairs, and as I
passed the open door to the cabin I glanced in.&nbsp; There sat
Captain West, whom I had thought still on deck.&nbsp; His
storm-trappings were removed, his sea-boots replaced by slippers;
and he leaned back in the big leather chair, eyes wide open,
beholding visions in the curling smoke of a cigar against a
background of wildly reeling cabin wall.</p>
<p>It was at eleven this morning that the Plate gave us a
fiasco.&nbsp; Last night&rsquo;s was a real pampero&mdash;though
a mild one.&nbsp; To-day&rsquo;s promised to be a far worse one,
and then laughed at us as a proper cosmic joke.&nbsp; The wind,
during the night, had so eased that by nine in the morning we had
all our topgallant-sails set.&nbsp; By ten we were rolling in a
dead calm.&nbsp; By eleven the stuff began making up ominously in
the south&rsquo;ard.</p>
<p>The overcast sky closed down.&nbsp; Our lofty trucks seemed to
scrape the cloud-zenith.&nbsp; The horizon drew in on us till it
seemed scarcely half a mile away.&nbsp; The <i>Elsinore</i> was
embayed in a tiny universe of mist and sea.&nbsp; The lightning
played.&nbsp; Sky and horizon drew so close that the
<i>Elsinore</i> seemed on the verge of being absorbed, sucked in
by it, sucked up by it.</p>
<p>Then from zenith to horizon the sky was cracked with forked
lightning, and the wet atmosphere turned to a horrid green.&nbsp;
The rain, beginning gently, in dead calm, grew into a deluge of
enormous streaming drops.&nbsp; It grew darker and darker, a
green darkness, and in the cabin, although it was midday, Wada
and the steward lighted lamps.&nbsp; The lightning came closer
and closer, until the ship was enveloped in it.&nbsp; The green
darkness was continually a-tremble with flame, through which
broke greater illuminations of forked lightning.&nbsp; These
became more violent as the rain lessened, and, so absolutely were
we centred in this electrical maelstrom, there was no connecting
any chain or flash or fork of lightning with any particular
thunder-clap.&nbsp; The atmosphere all about us paled and
flamed.&nbsp; Such a crashing and smashing!&nbsp; We looked every
moment for the <i>Elsinore</i> to be struck.&nbsp; And never had
I seen such colours in lightning.&nbsp; Although from moment to
moment we were dazzled by the greater bolts, there persisted
always a tremulous, pulsing lesser play of light, sometimes
softly blue, at other times a thin purple that quivered on into a
thousand shades of lavender.</p>
<p>And there was no wind.&nbsp; No wind came.&nbsp; Nothing
happened.&nbsp; The <i>Elsinore</i>, naked-sparred, under only
lower-topsails, with spanker and crojack furled, was prepared for
anything.&nbsp; Her lower-topsails hung in limp emptiness from
the yards, heavy with rain and flapping soggily when she
rolled.&nbsp; The cloud mass thinned, the day brightened, the
green blackness passed into gray twilight, the lightning eased,
the thunder moved along away from us, and there was no
wind.&nbsp; In half an hour the sun was shining, the thunder
muttered intermittently along the horizon, and the
<i>Elsinore</i> still rolled in a hush of air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t tell, sir,&rdquo; Mr. Pike growled to
me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thirty years ago I was dismasted right here off
the Plate in a clap of wind that come on just as that come
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the changing of the watches, and Mr. Mellaire, who had
come on the poop to relieve the mate, stood beside me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the nastiest pieces of water in the
world,&rdquo; he concurred.&nbsp; &ldquo;Eighteen years ago the
Plate gave it to me&mdash;lost half our sticks, twenty hours on
our beam-ends, cargo shifted, and foundered.&nbsp; I was two days
in the boat before an English tramp picked us up.&nbsp; And none
of the other boats ever was picked up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Elsinore</i> behaved very well last
night,&rdquo; I put in cheerily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, hell, that wasn&rsquo;t nothing,&rdquo; Mr. Pike
grumbled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wait till you see a real pampero.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s a dirty stretch hereabouts, and I, for one, &rsquo;ll
be glad when we get across It.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d sooner have a
dozen Cape Horn snorters than one of these.&nbsp; How about you,
Mr. Mellaire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same here, sir,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Those
sou&rsquo;-westers are honest.&nbsp; You know what to
expect.&nbsp; But here you never know.&nbsp; The best of
ship-masters can get tripped up off the Plate.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;As I&rsquo;ve found out . . .<br />
Beyond a doubt,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Pike hummed from Newcomb&rsquo;s <i>Celeste</i>, as he
went down the ladder.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
<p>The sunsets grow more bizarre and spectacular off this coast
of the Argentine.&nbsp; Last evening we had high clouds, broken
white and golden, flung disorderly, generously, over the western
half of the sky, while in the east was painted a second
sunset&mdash;a reflection, perhaps, of the first.&nbsp; At any
rate, the eastern sky was a bank of pale clouds that shed soft,
spread rays of blue and white upon a blue-grey sea.</p>
<p>And the evening before last we had a gorgeous Arizona riot in
the west.&nbsp; Bastioned upon the ocean cloud-tier was piled
upon cloud-tier, spacious and lofty, until we gazed upon a Grand
Canyon a myriad times vaster and more celestial than that of the
Colorado.&nbsp; The clouds took on the same stratified, serrated,
rose-rock formation, and all the hollows were filled with the
opal blues and purple hazes of the Painted Lands.</p>
<p>The Sailing Directions say that these remarkable sunsets are
due to the dust being driven high into the air by the winds that
blow across the pampas of the Argentine.</p>
<p>And our sunset to-night&mdash;I am writing this at midnight,
as I sit propped in my blankets, wedged by pillows, while the
<i>Elsinore</i> wallows damnably in a dead calm and a huge swell
rolling up from the Cape Horn region, where, it does seem, gales
perpetually blow.&nbsp; But our sunset.&nbsp; Turner might have
perpetrated it.&nbsp; The west was as if a painter had stood off
and slapped brushfuls of gray at a green canvas.&nbsp; On this
green background of sky the clouds spilled and crumpled.</p>
<p>But such a background!&nbsp; Such an orgy of green!&nbsp; No
shade of green was missing in the interstices, large and small,
between the milky, curdled clouds&mdash;Nile-green high up, and
then, in order, each with a thousand shades, blue-green,
brown-green, grey-green, and a wonderful olive-green that
tarnished into a rich bronze-green.</p>
<p>During the display the rest of the horizon glowed with broad
bands of pink, and blue, and pale green, and yellow.&nbsp; A
little later, when the sun was quite down, in the background of
the curdled clouds smouldered a wine-red mass of colour, that
faded to bronze and tinged all the fading greens with its
sanguinary hue.&nbsp; The clouds themselves flushed to rose of
all shades, while a fan of gigantic streamers of pale rose
radiated toward the zenith.&nbsp; These deepened rapidly into
flaunting rose-flame and burned long in the slow-closing
twilight.</p>
<p>And with all this wonder of the beauty of the world still
glowing in my brain hours afterward, I hear the snarling of Mr.
Pike above my head, and the trample and drag of feet as the men
move from rope to rope and pull and haul.&nbsp; More weather is
making, and from the way sail is being taken in it cannot be far
off.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Yet at daylight this morning we were still wallowing in the
same dead calm and sickly swell.&nbsp; Miss West says the
barometer is down, but that the warning has been too long, for
the Plate, to amount to anything.&nbsp; Pamperos happen quickly
here, and though the <i>Elsinore</i>, under bare poles to her
upper-topsails, is prepared for anything, it may well be that
they will be crowding on canvas in another hour.</p>
<p>Mr. Pike was so fooled that he actually had set the
topgallant-sails, and the gaskets were being taken off the
royals, when the Samurai came on deck, strolled back and forth a
casual five minutes, then spoke in an undertone to Mr.
Pike.&nbsp; Mr. Pike did not like it.&nbsp; To me, a tyro, it was
evident that he disagreed with his master.&nbsp; Nevertheless,
his voice went out in a snarl aloft to the men on the royal-yards
to make all fast again.&nbsp; Then it was clewlines and buntlines
and lowering of yards as the topgallant-sails were stripped
off.&nbsp; The crojack was taken in, and some of the outer
fore-and-aft handsails, whose order of names I can never
remember.</p>
<p>A breeze set in from the south-west, blowing briskly under a
clear sky.&nbsp; I could see that Mr. Pike was secretly
pleased.&nbsp; The Samurai had been mistaken.&nbsp; And each time
Mr. Pike glanced aloft at the naked topgallant- and royal-yards,
I knew his thought was that they might well be carrying
sail.&nbsp; I was quite convinced that the Plate had fooled
Captain West.&nbsp; So was Miss West convinced, and, being a
favoured person like myself, she frankly told me so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father will be setting sail in half an hour,&rdquo; she
prophesied.</p>
<p>What superior weather-sense Captain West possesses I know not,
save that it is his by Samurai right.&nbsp; The sky, as I have
said, was clear.&nbsp; The air was brittle&mdash;sparkling
gloriously in the windy sun.&nbsp; And yet, behold, in a brief
quarter of an hour, the change that took place.&nbsp; I had just
returned from a trip below, and Miss West was venting her scorn
on the River Plate and promising to go below to the
sewing-machine, when we heard Mr. Pike groan.&nbsp; It was a
whimsical groan of disgust, contrition, and acknowledgment of
inferiority before the master.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here comes the whole River Plate,&rdquo; was what he
groaned.</p>
<p>Following his gaze to the south-west, we saw it coming.&nbsp;
It was a cloud-mass that blotted out the sunlight and the
day.&nbsp; It seemed to swell and belch and roll over and over on
itself as it advanced with a rapidity that told of enormous wind
behind it and in it.&nbsp; Its speed was headlong, terrific; and,
beneath it, covering the sea, advancing with it, was a gray bank
of mist.</p>
<p>Captain West spoke to the mate, who bawled the order along,
and the watch, reinforced by the watch below, began dewing up the
mainsail and foresail and climbing into the rigging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep off!&nbsp; Put your wheel over!&nbsp; Hard
over!&rdquo; Captain West called gently to the helmsman.</p>
<p>And the big wheel spun around, and the <i>Elsinore&rsquo;s</i>
bow fell off so that she might not be caught aback by the
onslaught of wind.</p>
<p>Thunder rode in that rushing, rolling blackness of cloud; and
it was rent by lightning as it fell upon us.</p>
<p>Then it was rain, wind, obscureness of gloom, and
lightning.&nbsp; I caught a glimpse of the men on the lower-yards
as they were blotted from view and as the <i>Elsinore</i> heeled
over and down.&nbsp; There were fifteen men of them to each yard,
and the gaskets were well passed ere we were struck.&nbsp; How
they regained the deck I do not know, I never saw; for the
<i>Elsinore</i>, under only upper- and lower-topsails, lay down
on her side, her port-rail buried in the sea, and did not
rise.</p>
<p>There was no maintaining an unsupported upright position on
that acute slant of deck.&nbsp; Everybody held on.&nbsp; Mr. Pike
frankly gripped the poop-rail with both hands, and Miss West and
I made frantic clutches and scrambled for footing.&nbsp; But I
noticed that the Samurai, poised lightly, like a bird on the
verge of flight, merely rested one hand on the rail.&nbsp; He
gave no orders.&nbsp; As I divined, there was nothing to be
done.&nbsp; He waited&mdash;that was all&mdash;in tranquillity
and repose.&nbsp; The situation was simple.&nbsp; Either the
masts would go, or the <i>Elsinore</i> would rise with her masts
intact, or she would never rise again.</p>
<p>In the meantime she lay dead, her lee yardarms almost touching
the sea, the sea creaming solidly to her hatch-combings across
the buried, unseen rail.</p>
<p>The minutes were as centuries, until the bow paid off and the
<i>Elsinore</i>, turned tail before it, righted to an even
keel.&nbsp; Immediately this was accomplished Captain West had
her brought back upon the wind.&nbsp; And immediately, thereupon,
the big foresail went adrift from its gaskets.&nbsp; The shock,
or succession of shocks, to the ship, from the tremendous
buffeting that followed, was fearful.&nbsp; It seemed she was
being racked to pieces.&nbsp; Master and mate were side by side
when this happened, and the expressions on their faces typified
them.&nbsp; In neither face was apprehension.&nbsp; Mr.
Pike&rsquo;s face bore a sour sneer for the worthless sailors who
had botched the job.&nbsp; Captain West&rsquo;s face was serenely
considerative.</p>
<p>Still, nothing was to be done, could be done; and for five
minutes the <i>Elsinore</i> was shaken as in the maw of some
gigantic monster, until the last shreds of the great piece of
canvas had been torn away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our foresail has departed for Africa,&rdquo; Miss West
laughed in my ear.</p>
<p>She is like her father, unaware of fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now we may as well go below and be
comfortable,&rdquo; she said five minutes later.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
worst is over.&nbsp; It will only be blow, blow, blow, and a big
sea making.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>All day it blew.&nbsp; And the big sea that arose made the
<i>Elsinore&rsquo;s</i> conduct almost unlivable.&nbsp; My only
comfort was achieved by taking to my bunk and wedging myself with
pillows buttressed against the bunk&rsquo;s sides by empty
soap-boxes which Wada arranged.&nbsp; Mr. Pike, clinging to my
door-casing while his legs sprawled adrift in a succession of
terrific rolls, paused to tell me that it was a new one on him in
the pampero line.&nbsp; It was all wrong from the first.&nbsp; It
had not come on right.&nbsp; It had no reason to be.</p>
<p>He paused a little longer, and, in a casual way, that under
the circumstances was ridiculously transparent, exposed what was
at ferment in his mind.</p>
<p>First of all he was absurd enough to ask if Possum showed
symptoms of sea-sickness.&nbsp; Next, he unburdened his wrath for
the inefficients who had lost the foresail, and sympathized with
the sail-makers for the extra work thrown upon them.&nbsp; Then
he asked permission to borrow one of my books, and, clinging to
my bunk, selected Buchner&rsquo;s <i>Force and Matter</i> from my
shelf, carefully wedging the empty space with the doubled
magazine I use for that purpose.</p>
<p>Still he was loth to depart, and, cudgelling his brains for a
pretext, he set up a rambling discourse on River Plate
weather.&nbsp; And all the time I kept wondering what was behind
it all.&nbsp; At last it came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, Mr. Pathurst,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;do
you happen to remember how many years ago Mr. Mellaire said it
was that he was dismasted and foundered off here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I caught his drift on the instant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eight years ago, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; I lied.</p>
<p>Mr. Pike let this sink in and slowly digested it, while the
<i>Elsinore</i> was guilty of three huge rolls down to port and
back again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I wonder what ship was sunk off the Plate eight
years ago?&rdquo; he communed, as if with himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
guess I&rsquo;ll have to ask Mr. Mellaire her name.&nbsp; You can
search me for all any I can recollect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thanked me with unwonted elaborateness for <i>Force and
Matter</i>, of which I knew he would never read a line, and felt
his way to the door.&nbsp; Here he hung on for a moment, as if
struck by a new and most accidental idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now it wasn&rsquo;t, by any chance, that he said
eighteen years ago?&rdquo; he queried.</p>
<p>I shook my head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eight years ago,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way I remember it, though why I should
remember it at all I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; But that is what he
said,&rdquo; I went on with increasing confidence.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Eight years ago.&nbsp; I am sure of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Pike looked at me ponderingly, and waited until the
<i>Elsinore</i> had fairly righted for an instant ere he took his
departure down the hall.</p>
<p>I think I have followed the working of his mind.&nbsp; I have
long since learned that his memory of ships, officers, cargoes,
gales, and disasters is remarkable.&nbsp; He is a veritable
encyclop&aelig;dia of the sea.&nbsp; Also, it is patent that he
has equipped himself with Sidney Waltham&rsquo;s history.&nbsp;
As yet, he does not dream that Mr. Mellaire is Sidney Waltham,
and he is merely wondering if Mr. Mellaire was a ship-mate of
Sidney Waltham eighteen years ago in the ship lost off the
Plate.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I shall never forgive Mr. Mellaire for this
slip he has made.&nbsp; He should have been more careful.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>
<p>An abominable night!&nbsp; A wonderful night!&nbsp;
Sleep?&nbsp; I suppose I did sleep, in catnaps, but I swear I
heard every bell struck until three-thirty.&nbsp; Then came a
change, an easement.&nbsp; No longer was it a stubborn, loggy
fight against pressures.&nbsp; The <i>Elsinore</i> moved.&nbsp; I
could feel her slip, and slide, and send, and soar.&nbsp; Whereas
before she had been flung continually down to port, she now
rolled as far to one side as to the other.</p>
<p>I knew what had taken place.&nbsp; Instead of remaining
hove-to on the pampero, Captain West had turned tail and was
running before it.&nbsp; This, I understood, meant a really
serious storm, for the north-east was the last direction in which
Captain West desired to go.&nbsp; But at any rate the movement,
though wilder, was easier, and I slept.&nbsp; I was awakened at
five by the thunder of seas that fell aboard, rushed down the
main deck, and crashed against the cabin wall.&nbsp; Through my
open door I could see water swashing up and down the hall, while
half a foot of water creamed and curdled from under my bunk
across the floor each time the ship rolled to starboard.</p>
<p>The steward brought me my coffee, and, wedged by boxes and
pillows, like an equilibrist, I sat up and drank it.&nbsp;
Luckily I managed to finish it in time, for a succession of
terrific rolls emptied one of my book-shelves.&nbsp; Possum,
crawling upward from my feet under the covered way of my bed,
yapped with terror as the seas smashed and thundered and as the
avalanche of books descended upon us.&nbsp; And I could not but
grin when the <i>Paste Board Crown</i> smote me on the head,
while the puppy was knocked gasping with Chesterton&rsquo;s
<i>What&rsquo;s Wrong with the World</i>?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you think?&rdquo; I queried of the
steward who was helping to set us and the books to rights.</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders, and his bright slant eyes were very
bright as he replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many times I see like this.&nbsp; Me old man.&nbsp;
Many times I see more bad.&nbsp; Too much wind, too much
work.&nbsp; Rotten dam bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could guess that the scene on deck was a spectacle, and at
six o&rsquo;clock, as gray light showed through my ports in the
intervals when they were not submerged, I essayed the side-board
of my bunk like a gymnast, captured my careering slippers, and
shuddered as I thrust my bare feet into their chill
sogginess.&nbsp; I did not wait to dress.&nbsp; Merely in pyjamas
I headed for the poop, Possum wailing dismally at my
desertion.</p>
<p>It was a feat to travel the narrow halls.&nbsp; Time and again
I paused and held on until my finger-tips hurt.&nbsp; In the
moments of easement I made progress.&nbsp; Yet I
miscalculated.&nbsp; The foot of the broad stairway to the
chart-house rested on a cross-hall a dozen feet in length.&nbsp;
Over-confidence and an unusually violent antic of the
<i>Elsinore</i> caused the disaster.&nbsp; She flung down to
starboard with such suddenness and at such a pitch that the
flooring seemed to go out from under me and I hustled helplessly
down the incline.&nbsp; I missed a frantic clutch at the
newel-post, flung up my arm in time to save my face, and, most
fortunately, whirled half about, and, still falling, impacted
with my shoulder muscle-pad on Captain West&rsquo;s door.</p>
<p>Youth will have its way.&nbsp; So will a ship in a sea.&nbsp;
And so will a hundred and seventy pounds of a man.&nbsp; The
beautiful hardwood door-panel splintered, the latch fetched away,
and I broke the nails of the four fingers of my right hand in a
futile grab at the flying door, marring the polished surface with
four parallel scratches.&nbsp; I kept right on, erupting into
Captain West&rsquo;s spacious room with the big brass bed.</p>
<p>Miss West, swathed in a woollen dressing-gown, her eyes heavy
still with sleep, her hair glorious and for the once ungroomed,
clinging in the doorway that gave entrance on the main cabin, met
my startled gaze with an equally startled gaze.</p>
<p>It was no time for apologies.&nbsp; I kept right on my mad
way, caught the foot stanchion, and was whipped around in half a
circle flat upon Captain West&rsquo;s brass bed.</p>
<p>Miss West was beginning to laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come right in,&rdquo; she gurgled.</p>
<p>A score of retorts, all deliciously inadvisable, tickled my
tongue, so I said nothing, contenting myself with holding on with
my left hand while I nursed my stinging right hand under my
arm-pit.&nbsp; Beyond her, across the floor of the main cabin, I
saw the steward in pursuit of Captain West&rsquo;s Bible and a
sheaf of Miss West&rsquo;s music.&nbsp; And as she gurgled and
laughed at me, beholding her in this intimacy of storm, the
thought flashed through my brain:</p>
<p><i>She is a woman</i>.&nbsp; <i>She is desirable</i>.</p>
<p>Now did she sense this fleeting, unuttered flash of
mine?&nbsp; I know not, save that her laughter left her, and long
conventional training asserted itself as she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just knew everything was adrift in father&rsquo;s
room.&nbsp; He hasn&rsquo;t been in it all night.&nbsp; I could
hear things rolling around . . . What is wrong?&nbsp; Are you
hurt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stubbed my fingers, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; I
answered, looking at my broken nails and standing gingerly
upright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My, that <i>was</i> a roll,&rdquo; she sympathized.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I&rsquo;d started to go upstairs,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;and not to turn into your father&rsquo;s bed.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ve ruined the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Came another series of great rolls.&nbsp; I sat down on the
bed and held on.&nbsp; Miss West, secure in the doorway, began
gurgling again, while beyond, across the cabin carpet, the
steward shot past, embracing a small writing-desk that had
evidently carried away from its fastenings when he seized hold of
it for support.&nbsp; More seas smashed and crashed against the
for&rsquo;ard wall of the cabin; and the steward, failing of
lodgment, shot back across the carpet, still holding the desk
from harm.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of favouring spells, I managed to effect my
exit and gain the newel-post ere the next series of rolls
came.&nbsp; And as I clung on and waited, I could not forget what
I had just seen.&nbsp; Vividly under my eyelids burned the
picture of Miss West&rsquo;s sleep-laden eyes, her hair, and all
the softness of her.&nbsp; <i>A woman and desirable</i> kept
drumming in my brain.</p>
<p>But I forgot all this, when, nearly at the top, I was thrown
up the hill of the stairs as if it had suddenly become
downhill.&nbsp; My feet flew from stair to stair to escape
falling, and I flew, or fell, apparently upward, until, at the
top, I hung on for dear life while the stern of the
<i>Elsinore</i> flung skyward on some mighty surge.</p>
<p>Such antics of so huge a ship!&nbsp; The old stereotyped
&ldquo;toy&rdquo; describes her; for toy she was, the sheerest
splinter of a plaything in the grip of the elements.&nbsp; And
yet, despite this overwhelming sensation of microscopic
helplessness, I was aware of a sense of surety.&nbsp; There was
the Samurai.&nbsp; Informed with his will and wisdom, the
<i>Elsinore</i> was no cat&rsquo;s-paw.&nbsp; Everything was
ordered, controlled.&nbsp; She was doing what he ordained her to
do, and, no matter what storm-Titans bellowed about her and
buffeted her, she would continue to do what he ordained her to
do.</p>
<p>I glanced into the chart-room.&nbsp; There he sat, leaned back
in a screw-chair, his sea-booted legs, wedged against the settee,
holding him in place in the most violent rolls.&nbsp; His black
oilskin coat glistened in the lamplight with a myriad drops of
ocean that advertised a recent return from deck.&nbsp; His
sou&rsquo;wester, black and glistening, was like the helmet of
some legendary hero.&nbsp; He was smoking a cigar, and he smiled
and greeted me.&nbsp; But he seemed very tired and very
old&mdash;old with wisdom, however, not weakness.&nbsp; The flesh
of his face, the pink pigment quite washed and worn away, was
more transparent than ever; and yet never was he more serene,
never more the master absolute of our tiny, fragile world.&nbsp;
The age that showed in him was not a matter of terrestrial
years.&nbsp; It was ageless, passionless, beyond human.&nbsp;
Never had he appeared so great to me, so far remote, so much a
spirit visitant.</p>
<p>And he cautioned and advised me, in silver-mellow beneficent
voice, as I essayed the venture of opening the chart-house door
to gain outside.&nbsp; He knew the moment, although I never could
have guessed it for myself, and gave the word that enabled me to
win the poop.</p>
<p>Water was everywhere.&nbsp; The <i>Elsinore</i> was rushing
through a blurring whirr of water.&nbsp; Seas creamed and licked
the poop-deck edge, now to starboard, now to port.&nbsp; High in
the air, over-towering and perilously down-toppling,
following-seas pursued our stern.&nbsp; The air was filled with
spindrift like a fog or spray.&nbsp; No officer of the watch was
in sight.&nbsp; The poop was deserted, save for two helmsmen in
streaming oilskins under the half-shelter of the open
wheel-house.&nbsp; I nodded good morning to them.</p>
<p>One was Tom Spink, the elderly but keen and dependable English
sailor.&nbsp; The other was Bill Quigley, one of a forecastle
group of three that herded uniquely together, though the other
two, Frank Fitzgibbon and Richard Oiler, were in the second
mate&rsquo;s watch.&nbsp; The three had proved handy with their
fists, and clannish; they had fought pitched forecastle battles
with the gangster clique and won a sort of neutrality of
independence for themselves.&nbsp; They were not exactly
sailors&mdash;Mr. Mellaire sneeringly called them the
&ldquo;bricklayers&rdquo;&mdash;but they had successfully refused
subservience to the gangster crowd.</p>
<p>To cross the deck from the chart-house to the break of the
poop was no slight feat, but I managed it and hung on to the
railing while the wind stung my flesh with the flappings of my
pyjamas.&nbsp; At this moment, and for the moment, the
<i>Elsinore</i> righted to an even keel, and dashed along and
down the avalanching face of a wave.&nbsp; And as she thus
righted her deck was filled with water level from rail to
rail.&nbsp; Above this flood, or knee-deep in it, Mr. Pike and
half-a-dozen sailors were bunched on the fife-rail of the
mizzen-mast.&nbsp; The carpenter, too, was there, with a couple
of assistants.</p>
<p>The next roll spilled half a thousand tons of water outboard
sheer over the starboard-rail, while all the starboard ports
opened automatically and gushed huge streams.&nbsp; Then came the
opposite roll to port, with a clanging shut of the iron doors;
and a hundred tons of sea sloshed outboard across the port-rail,
while all the iron doors on that side opened wide and
gushed.&nbsp; And all this time, it must not be forgotten, the
<i>Elsinore</i> was dashing ahead through the sea.</p>
<p>The only sail she carried was three upper-topsails.&nbsp; Not
the tiniest triangle of headsail was on her.&nbsp; I had never
seen her with so little wind-surface, and the three narrow strips
of canvas, bellied to the seemingness of sheet-iron with the
pressure of the wind, drove her before the gale at astonishing
speed.</p>
<p>As the water on the deck subsided the men on the fife-rail
left their refuge.&nbsp; One group, led by the redoubtable Mr.
Pike, strove to capture a mass of planks and twisted steel.&nbsp;
For the moment I did not recognize what it was.&nbsp; The
carpenter, with two men, sprang upon Number Three hatch and
worked hurriedly and fearfully.&nbsp; And I knew why Captain West
had turned tail to the storm.&nbsp; Number Three hatch was a
wreck.&nbsp; Among other things the great timber, called the
&ldquo;strong-back,&rdquo; was broken.&nbsp; He had had to run,
or founder.&nbsp; Before our decks were swept again I could make
out the carpenter&rsquo;s emergency repairs.&nbsp; With fresh
timbers he was bolting, lashing, and wedging Number Three hatch
into some sort of tightness.</p>
<p>When the <i>Elsinore</i> dipped her port-rail under and
scooped several hundred tons of South Atlantic, and then,
immediately rolling her starboard-rail under, had another hundred
tons of breaking sea fall in board upon her, all the men forsook
everything and scrambled for life upon the fife-rail.&nbsp; In
the bursting spray they were quite hidden; and then I saw them
and counted them all as they emerged into view.&nbsp; Again they
waited for the water to subside.</p>
<p>The mass of wreckage pursued by Mr. Pike and his men ground a
hundred feet along the deck for&rsquo;ard, and, as the
<i>Elsinore&rsquo;s</i> stern sank down in some abyss, ground
back again and smashed up against the cabin wall.&nbsp; I
identified this stuff as part of the bridge.&nbsp; That portion
which spanned from the mizzen-mast to the &rsquo;midship-house
was missing, while the starboard boat on the &rsquo;midship-house
was a splintered mess.</p>
<p>Watching the struggle to capture and subdue the section of
bridge, I was reminded of Victor Hugo&rsquo;s splendid
description of the sailor&rsquo;s battle with a ship&rsquo;s gun
gone adrift in a night of storm.&nbsp; But there was a
difference, I found that Hugo&rsquo;s narrative had stirred me
more profoundly than was I stirred by this actual struggle before
my eyes.</p>
<p>I have repeatedly said that the sea makes one hard.&nbsp; I
now realized how hard I had become as I stood there at the break
of the poop in my wind-shipped, spray-soaked pyjamas.&nbsp; I
felt no solicitude for the forecastle humans who struggled in
peril of their lives beneath me.&nbsp; They did not count.&nbsp;
Ah&mdash;I was even curious to see what might happen, did they
get caught by those crashing avalanches of sea ere they could
gain the safety of the fife-rail.</p>
<p>And I saw.&nbsp; Mr. Pike, in the lead, of course, up to his
waist in rushing water, dashed in, caught the flying wreckage
with a turn of rope, and fetched it up short with a turn around
one of the port mizzen-shrouds.&nbsp; The <i>Elsinore</i> flung
down to port, and a solid wall of down-toppling green upreared a
dozen feet above the rail.&nbsp; The men fled to the
fife-rail.&nbsp; But Mr. Pike, holding his turn, held on, looked
squarely into the wall of the wave, and received the
downfall.&nbsp; He emerged, still holding by the turn the
captured bridge.</p>
<p>The feeble-minded faun (the stone-deaf man) led the way to Mr.
Pike&rsquo;s assistance, followed by Tony, the suicidal
Greek.&nbsp; Paddy was next, and in order came Shorty, Henry the
training-ship boy, and Nancy, last, of course, and looking as if
he were going to execution.</p>
<p>The deck-water was no more than knee-deep, though rushing with
torrential force, when Mr. Pike and the six men lifted the
section of bridge and started for&rsquo;ard with it.&nbsp; They
swayed and staggered, but managed to keep going.</p>
<p>The carpenter saw the impending ocean-mountain first.&nbsp; I
saw him cry to his own men and then to Mr. Pike ere he fled to
the fife-rail.&nbsp; But Mr. Pike&rsquo;s men had no
chance.&nbsp; Abreast of the &rsquo;midship-house, on the
starboard side, fully fifteen feet above the rail and twenty
above the deck, the sea fell on board.&nbsp; The top of the
&rsquo;midship-house was swept clean of the splintered
boat.&nbsp; The water, impacting against the side of the house,
spouted skyward as high as the crojack-yard.&nbsp; And all this,
in addition to the main bulk of the wave, swept and descended
upon Mr. Pike and his men.</p>
<p>They disappeared.&nbsp; The bridge disappeared.&nbsp; The
<i>Elsinore</i> rolled to port and dipped her deck full from rail
to rail.&nbsp; Next, she plunged down by the head, and all this
mass of water surged forward.&nbsp; Through the creaming, foaming
surface now and then emerged an arm, or a head, or a back, while
cruel edges of jagged plank and twisted steel rods advertised
that the bridge was turning over and over.&nbsp; I wondered what
men were beneath it and what mauling they were receiving.</p>
<p>And yet these men did not count.&nbsp; I was aware of anxiety
only for Mr. Pike.&nbsp; He, in a way, socially, was of my caste
and class.&nbsp; He and I belonged aft in the high place; ate at
the same table.&nbsp; I was acutely desirous that he should not
be hurt or killed.&nbsp; The rest did not matter.&nbsp; They were
not of my world.&nbsp; I imagine the old-time skippers, on the
middle passage, felt much the same toward their slave-cargoes in
the fetid &rsquo;tween decks.</p>
<p>The <i>Elsinore&rsquo;s</i> bow tilted skyward while her stern
fell into a foaming valley.&nbsp; Not a man had gained his
feet.&nbsp; Bridge and men swept back toward me and fetched up
against the mizzen-shrouds.&nbsp; And then that prodigious,
incredible old man appeared out of the water, on his two legs,
upright, dragging with him, a man in each hand, the helpless
forms of Nancy and the Faun.&nbsp; My heart leapt at beholding
this mighty figure of a man-killer and slave-driver, it is true,
but who sprang first into the teeth of danger so that his slaves
might follow, and who emerged with a half-drowned slave in either
hand.</p>
<p>I knew augustness and pride as I gazed&mdash;pride that my
eyes were blue, like his; that my skin was blond, like his; that
my place was aft with him, and with the Samurai, in the high
place of government and command.&nbsp; I nearly wept with the
chill of pride that was akin to awe and that tingled and bristled
along my spinal column and in my brain.&nbsp; As for the
rest&mdash;the weaklings and the rejected, and the dark-pigmented
things, the half-castes, the mongrel-bloods, and the dregs of
long-conquered races&mdash;how could they count?&nbsp; My heels
were iron as I gazed on them in their peril and weakness.&nbsp;
Lord!&nbsp; Lord!&nbsp; For ten thousand generations and
centuries we had stamped upon their faces and enslaved them to
the toil of our will.</p>
<p>Again the <i>Elsinore</i> rolled to starboard and to port,
while the spume spouted to our lower-yards and a thousand tons of
South Atlantic surged across from rail to rail.&nbsp; And again
all were down and under, with jagged plank and twisted steel
overriding them.&nbsp; And again that amazing blond-skinned giant
emerged, on his two legs upstanding, a broken waif like a rat in
either hand.&nbsp; He forced his way through rushing, waist-high
water, deposited his burdens with the carpenter on the fife-rail,
and returned to drag Larry reeling to his feet and help him to
the fife-rail.&nbsp; Out of the wash, Tony, the Greek, crawled on
hands and knees and sank down helplessly at the fife-rail.&nbsp;
There was nothing suicidal now in his mood.&nbsp; Struggle as he
would, he could not lift himself until the mate, gripping his
oilskin at the collar, with one hand flung him through the air
into the carpenter&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>Next came Shorty, his face streaming blood, one arm hanging
useless, his sea-boots stripped from him.&nbsp; Mr. Pike pitched
him into the fife-rail, and returned for the last man.&nbsp; It
was Henry, the training-ship boy.&nbsp; Him I had seen,
unstruggling, motionless, show at the surface like a drowned man
and sink again as the flood surged aft and smashed him against
the cabin.&nbsp; Mr. Pike, shoulder-deep, twice beaten to his
knees and under by bursting seas, caught the lad, shouldered him,
and carried him away for&rsquo;ard.</p>
<p>An hour later, in the cabin, I encountered Mr. Pike going into
breakfast.&nbsp; He had changed his clothes, and he had
shaved!&nbsp; Now how could one treat a hero such as he save as I
treated him when I remarked off-handedly that he must have had a
lively watch?</p>
<p>&ldquo;My,&rdquo; he answered, equally off-handedly, &ldquo;I
did get a prime soaking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was all.&nbsp; He had had no time to see me at the
poop-rail.&nbsp; It was merely the day&rsquo;s work, the
ship&rsquo;s work, the MAN&rsquo;S work&mdash;all capitals, if
you please, in MAN.&nbsp; I was the only one aft who knew, and I
knew because I had chanced to see.&nbsp; Had I not been on the
poop at that early hour no one aft ever would have known those
gray, storm-morning deeds of his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anybody hurt?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, some of the men got wet.&nbsp; But no bones
broke.&nbsp; Henry&rsquo;ll be laid off for a day.&nbsp; He got
turned over in a sea and bashed his head.&nbsp; And
Shorty&rsquo;s got a wrenched shoulder, I think.&mdash;But, say,
we got Davis into the top bunk!&nbsp; The seas filled him full
and he had to climb for it.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s all awash and wet
now, and you oughta seen me praying for more.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
paused and sighed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting old, I
guess.&nbsp; I oughta wring his neck, but somehow I ain&rsquo;t
got the gumption.&nbsp; Just the same, he&rsquo;ll be overside
before we get in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A month&rsquo;s wages against a pound of tobacco he
won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I challenged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mr. Pike slowly.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
I&rsquo;ll tell you what I will do.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll bet you a
pound of tobacco even, or a month&rsquo;s wages even, that
I&rsquo;ll have the pleasure of putting a sack of coal to his
feet that never will come off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done,&rdquo; said Mr. Pike.&nbsp; &ldquo;And now I
guess I&rsquo;ll get a bite to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>
<p>The more I see of Miss West the more she pleases me.&nbsp;
Explain it in terms of propinquity, or isolation, or whatever you
will; I, at least, do not attempt explanation.&nbsp; I know only
that she is a woman and desirable.&nbsp; And I am rather proud,
in a way, to find that I am just a man like any man.&nbsp; The
midnight oil, and the relentless pursuit I have endured in the
past from the whole tribe of women, have not, I am glad to say,
utterly spoiled me.</p>
<p>I am obsessed by that phrase&mdash;a <i>woman and
desirable</i>.&nbsp; It beats in my brain, in my thought.&nbsp; I
go out of my way to steal a glimpse of Miss West through a cabin
door or vista of hall when she does not know I am looking.&nbsp;
A woman is a wonderful thing.&nbsp; A woman&rsquo;s hair is
wonderful.&nbsp; A woman&rsquo;s softness is a magic.&mdash;Oh, I
know them for what they are, and yet this very knowledge makes
them only the more wonderful.&nbsp; I know&mdash;I would stake my
soul&mdash;that Miss West has considered me as a mate a thousand
times to once that I have so considered her.&nbsp; And
yet&mdash;she is a woman and desirable.</p>
<p>And I find myself continually reminded of Richard Le
Gallienne&rsquo;s inimitable quatrain:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Were I a woman, I would all day long<br />
Sing my own beauty in some holy song,<br />
Bend low before it, hushed and half afraid,<br />
And say &lsquo;I am a woman&rsquo; all day long.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let me advise all philosophers suffering from world-sickness
to take a long sea voyage with a woman like Miss West.</p>
<p>In this narrative I shall call her &ldquo;Miss West&rdquo; no
more.&nbsp; She has ceased to be Miss West.&nbsp; She is
Margaret.&nbsp; I do not think of her as Miss West.&nbsp; I think
of her as Margaret.&nbsp; It is a pretty word, a
woman-word.&nbsp; What poet must have created it!&nbsp;
Margaret!&nbsp; I never tire of it.&nbsp; My tongue is enamoured
of it.&nbsp; Margaret West!&nbsp; What a name to conjure
with!&nbsp; A name provocative of dreams and mighty
connotations.&nbsp; The history of our westward-faring race is
written in it.&nbsp; There is pride in it, and dominion, and
adventure, and conquest.&nbsp; When I murmur it I see visions of
lean, beaked ships, of winged helmets, and heels iron-shod of
restless men, royal lovers, royal adventurers, royal
fighters.&nbsp; Yes, and even now, in these latter days when the
sun consumes us, still we sit in the high seat of government and
command.</p>
<p>Oh&mdash;and by the way&mdash;she is twenty-four years
old.&nbsp; I asked Mr. Pike the date of the <i>Dixie&rsquo;s</i>
collision with the river steamer in San Francisco Bay.&nbsp; This
occurred in 1901.&nbsp; Margaret was twelve years old at the
time.&nbsp; This is 1913.&nbsp; Blessings on the head of the man
who invented arithmetic!&nbsp; She is twenty-four.&nbsp; Her name
is Margaret, and she is desirable.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>There are so many things to tell about.&nbsp; Where and how
this mad voyage, with a mad crew, will end is beyond all
surmise.&nbsp; But the <i>Elsinore</i> drives on, and day by day
her history is bloodily written.&nbsp; And while murder is done,
and while the whole floating drama moves toward the bleak
southern ocean and the icy blasts of Cape Horn, I sit in the high
place with the masters, unafraid, I am proud to say, in an
ecstasy, I am proud to say, and I murmur over and over to
<i>myself</i>&mdash;<i>Margaret</i>, <i>a woman</i>;
<i>Margaret</i>, <i>and desirable</i>.</p>
<p>But to resume.&nbsp; It is the first day of June.&nbsp; Ten
days have passed since the pampero.&nbsp; When the strong back on
Number Three hatch was repaired Captain West came back on the
wind, hove to, and rode out the gale.&nbsp; Since then, in calm,
and fog, and damp, and storm, we have won south until to-day we
are almost abreast of the Falklands.&nbsp; The coast of the
Argentine lies to the West, below the sea-line, and some time
this morning we crossed the fiftieth parallel of south
latitude.&nbsp; Here begins the passage of Cape Horn, for so it
is reckoned by the navigators&mdash;fifty south in the Atlantic
to fifty south in the Pacific.</p>
<p>And yet all is well with us in the matter of weather.&nbsp;
The <i>Elsinore</i> slides along with favouring winds.&nbsp;
Daily it grows colder.&nbsp; The great cabin stove roars and is
white-hot, and all the connecting doors are open, so that the
whole after region of the ship is warm and comfortable.&nbsp; But
on the deck the air bites, and Margaret and I wear mittens as we
promenade the poop or go for&rsquo;ard along the repaired bridge
to see the chickens on the &rsquo;midship-house.&nbsp; The poor,
wretched creatures of instinct and climate!&nbsp; Behold, as they
approach the southern mid-winter of the Horn, when they have need
of all their feathers, they proceed to moult, because, forsooth,
this is the summer time in the land they came from.&nbsp; Or is
moulting determined by the time of year they happen to be
born?&nbsp; I shall have to look into this.&nbsp; Margaret will
know.</p>
<p>Yesterday ominous preparations were made for the passage of
the Horn.&nbsp; All the braces were taken from the main deck
pin-rails and geared and arranged so that they may be worked from
the tops of the houses.</p>
<p>Thus, the fore-braces run to the top of the forecastle, the
main-braces to the top of the &rsquo;midship-house, and the
mizzen-braces to the poop.&nbsp; It is evident that they expect
our main deck frequently to be filled with water.&nbsp; So
evident is it that a laden ship when in big seas is like a log
awash, that fore and aft, on both sides, along the deck,
shoulder-high, life-lines have been rigged.&nbsp; Also, the two
iron doors, on port and starboard, that open from the cabin
directly upon the main deck, have been barricaded and
caulked.&nbsp; Not until we are in the Pacific and flying north
will these doors open again.</p>
<p>And while we prepare to battle around the stormiest headland
in the world our situation on board grows darker.&nbsp; This
morning Petro Marinkovich, a sailor in Mr. Mellaire&rsquo;s
watch, was found dead on Number One hatch.&nbsp; The body bore
several knife-wounds and the throat was cut.&nbsp; It was
palpably done by some one or several of the forecastle hands; but
not a word can be elicited.&nbsp; Those who are guilty of it are
silent, of course; while others who may chance to know are afraid
to speak.</p>
<p>Before midday the body was overside with the customary sack of
coal.&nbsp; Already the man is a past episode.&nbsp; But the
humans for&rsquo;ard are tense with expectancy of what is to
come.&nbsp; I strolled for&rsquo;ard this afternoon, and noted
for the first time a distinct hostility toward me.&nbsp; They
recognize that I belong with the after-guard in the high
place.&nbsp; Oh, nothing was said; but it was patent by the way
almost every man looked at me, or refused to look at me.&nbsp;
Only Mulligan Jacobs and Charles Davis were outspoken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good riddance,&rdquo; said Mulligan Jacobs.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The Guinea didn&rsquo;t have the spunk of a louse.&nbsp;
And he&rsquo;s better off, ain&rsquo;t he?&nbsp; He lived dirty,
an&rsquo; he died dirty, an&rsquo; now he&rsquo;s over an&rsquo;
done with the whole dirty game.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s men on board
that oughta wish they was as lucky as him.&nbsp; Theirs is still
a-coming to &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean . . . ?&rdquo; I queried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever you want to think I mean,&rdquo; the twisted
wretch grinned malevolently into my face.</p>
<p>Charles Davis, when I peeped into his iron room, was
exuberant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pretty tale for the court in Seattle,&rdquo; he
exulted.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll only make my case that much
stronger.&nbsp; And wait till the reporters get hold of it!&nbsp;
The hell-ship <i>Elsinore</i>!&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll have pretty
pickin&rsquo;s!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen any hell-ship,&rdquo; I said
coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve seen my treatment, ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
he retorted.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve seen the hell I&rsquo;ve
got, ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you for a cold-blooded murderer,&rdquo; I
answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The court will determine that, sir.&nbsp; All
you&rsquo;ll have to do is to testify to facts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll testify that had I been in the mate&rsquo;s
place I&rsquo;d have hanged you for murder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His eyes positively sparkled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask you to remember this conversation when
you&rsquo;re under oath, sir,&rdquo; he cried eagerly.</p>
<p>I confess the man aroused in me a reluctant admiration.&nbsp;
I looked about his mean, iron-walled room.&nbsp; During the
pampero the place had been awash.&nbsp; The white paint was
peeling off in huge scabs, and iron-rust was everywhere.&nbsp;
The floor was filthy.&nbsp; The place stank with the stench of
his sickness.&nbsp; His pannikin and unwashed eating-gear from
the last meal were scattered on the floor: His blankets were wet,
his clothing was wet.&nbsp; In a corner was a heterogeneous mass
of soggy, dirty garments.&nbsp; He lay in the very bunk in which
he had brained O&rsquo;Sullivan.&nbsp; He had been months in this
vile hole.&nbsp; In order to live he would have to remain months
more in it.&nbsp; And while his rat-like vitality won my
admiration, I loathed and detested him in very nausea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you afraid?&rdquo; I demanded.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What makes you think you will last the voyage?&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t you know bets are being made that you
won&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So interested was he that he seemed to prick up his ears as he
raised on his elbow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re too scared to tell me about them
bets,&rdquo; he sneered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve bet you&rsquo;ll last,&rdquo; I assured
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means there&rsquo;s others that bet I
won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he rattled on hastily.&nbsp; &ldquo;An&rsquo;
that means that there&rsquo;s men aboard the <i>Elsinore</i>
right now financially interested in my taking-off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment the steward, bound aft from the galley, paused
in the doorway and listened, grinning.&nbsp; As for Charles
Davis, the man had missed his vocation.&nbsp; He should have been
a land-lawyer, not a sea-lawyer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, sir,&rdquo; he went on.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have you testify to that in Seattle, unless
you&rsquo;re lying to a helpless sick man, or unless you&rsquo;ll
perjure yourself under oath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He got what he was seeking, for he stung me to retort:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll testify.&nbsp; Though I tell you
candidly that I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll win my
bet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You loose &rsquo;m bet sure,&rdquo; the steward broke
in, nodding his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;That fellow him die damn
soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bet with&rsquo;m, sir,&rdquo; David challenged
me.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a straight tip from me, an&rsquo; a
regular cinch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The whole situation was so gruesome and grotesque, and I had
been swept into it so absurdly, that for the moment I did not
know what to do or say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good money,&rdquo; Davis urged.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to die.&nbsp; Look here,
steward, how much you want to bet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five dollar, ten dollar, twenty dollar,&rdquo; the
steward answered, with a shoulder-shrug that meant that the sum
was immaterial.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well then, steward.&nbsp; Mr. Pathurst covers your
money, say for twenty.&nbsp; Is it a go, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you bet with him yourself?&rdquo; I
demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure I will, sir.&nbsp; Here, you steward, I bet you
twenty even I don&rsquo;t die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The steward shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bet you twenty to ten,&rdquo; the sick man
insisted.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s eatin&rsquo; you,
anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You live, me lose, me pay you,&rdquo; the steward
explained.&nbsp; &ldquo;You die, I win, you dead; no pay
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still grinning and shaking his head, he went his way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the same, sir, it&rsquo;ll be rich
testimony,&rdquo; David chuckled.&nbsp; &ldquo;An&rsquo;
can&rsquo;t you see the reporters eatin&rsquo; it up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Asiatic clique in the cook&rsquo;s room has its suspicions
about the death of Marinkovich, but will not voice them.&nbsp;
Beyond shakings of heads and dark mutterings, I can get nothing
out of Wada or the steward.&nbsp; When I talked with the
sail-maker, he complained that his injured hand was hurting him
and that he would be glad when he could get to the surgeons in
Seattle.&nbsp; As for the murder, when pressed by me, he gave me
to understand that it was no affair of the Japanese or Chinese on
board, and that he was a Japanese.</p>
<p>But Louis, the Chinese half-caste with the Oxford accent, was
more frank.&nbsp; I caught him aft from the galley on a trip to
the lazarette for provisions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are of a different race, sir, from these men,&rdquo;
he said; &ldquo;and our safest policy is to leave them
alone.&nbsp; We have talked it over, and we have nothing to say,
sir, nothing whatever to say.&nbsp; Consider my position.&nbsp; I
work for&rsquo;ard in the galley; I am in constant contact with
the sailors; I even sleep in their section of the ship; and I am
one man against many.&nbsp; The only other countryman I have on
board is the steward, and he sleeps aft.&nbsp; Your servant and
the two sail-makers are Japanese.&nbsp; They are only remotely
kin to us, though we&rsquo;ve agreed to stand together and apart
from whatever happens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is Shorty,&rdquo; I said, remembering Mr.
Pike&rsquo;s diagnosis of his mixed nationality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we do not recognize him, sir,&rdquo; Louis answered
suavely.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is Portuguese; he is Malay; he is
Japanese, true; but he is a mongrel, sir, a mongrel and a
bastard.&nbsp; Also, he is a fool.&nbsp; And please, sir,
remember that we are very few, and that our position compels us
to neutrality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But your outlook is gloomy,&rdquo; I persisted.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How do you think it will end?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall arrive in Seattle most probably, some of
us.&nbsp; But I can tell you this, sir: I have lived a long life
on the sea, but I have never seen a crew like this.&nbsp; There
are few sailors in it; there are bad men in it; and the rest are
fools and worse.&nbsp; You will notice I mention no names, sir;
but there are men on board whom I do not care to
antagonize.&nbsp; I am just Louis, the cook.&nbsp; I do my work
to the best of my ability, and that is all, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And will Charles Davis arrive in Seattle?&rdquo; I
asked, changing the topic in acknowledgment of his right to be
reticent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I do not think so, sir,&rdquo; he answered,
although his eyes thanked me for my courtesy.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
steward tells me you have bet that he will.&nbsp; I think, sir,
it is a poor bet.&nbsp; We are about to go around the Horn.&nbsp;
I have been around it many times.&nbsp; This is midwinter, and we
are going from east to west.&nbsp; Davis&rsquo; room will be
awash for weeks.&nbsp; It will never be dry.&nbsp; A strong
healthy man confined in it could well die of the hardship.&nbsp;
And Davis is far from well.&nbsp; In short, sir, I know his
condition, and he is in a shocking state.&nbsp; Surgeons might
prolong his life, but here in a wind-jammer it is shortened very
rapidly.&nbsp; I have seen many men die at sea.&nbsp; I know,
sir.&nbsp; Thank you, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the Eurasian Chinese-Englishman bowed himself away.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>
<p>Things are worse than I fancied.&nbsp; Here are two episodes
within the last seventy-two hours.&nbsp; Mr. Mellaire, for
instance, is going to pieces.&nbsp; He cannot stand the strain of
being on the same vessel with the man who has sworn to avenge
Captain Somers&rsquo;s murder, especially when that man is the
redoubtable Mr. Pike.</p>
<p>For several days Margaret and I have been remarking the second
mate&rsquo;s bloodshot eyes and pain-lined face and wondering if
he were sick.&nbsp; And to-day the secret leaked out.&nbsp; Wada
does not like Mr. Mellaire, and this morning, when he brought me
breakfast, I saw by the wicked, gleeful gleam in his almond eyes
that he was spilling over with some fresh, delectable
ship&rsquo;s gossip.</p>
<p>For several days, I learned, he and the steward have been
solving a cabin mystery.&nbsp; A gallon can of wood alcohol,
standing on a shelf in the after-room, had lost quite a portion
of its contents.&nbsp; They compared notes and then made of
themselves a Sherlock Holmes and a Doctor Watson.&nbsp; First,
they gauged the daily diminution of alcohol.&nbsp; Next they
gauged it several times daily, and learned that the diminution,
whenever it occurred, was first apparent immediately after
meal-time.&nbsp; This focussed their attention on two
suspects&mdash;the second mate and the carpenter, who alone sat
in the after-room.&nbsp; The rest was easy.&nbsp; Whenever Mr.
Mellaire arrived ahead of the carpenter more alcohol was
missing.&nbsp; When they arrived and departed together, the
alcohol was undisturbed.&nbsp; The carpenter was never alone in
the room.&nbsp; The syllogism was complete.&nbsp; And now the
steward stores the alcohol under his bunk.</p>
<p>But wood alcohol is deadly poison.&nbsp; What a constitution
this man of fifty must have!&nbsp; Small wonder his eyes have
been bloodshot.&nbsp; The great wonder is that the stuff did not
destroy him.</p>
<p>I have not whispered a word of this to Margaret; nor shall I
whisper it.&nbsp; I should like to put Mr. Pike on his guard; and
yet I know that the revealing of Mr. Mellaire&rsquo;s identity
would precipitate another killing.&nbsp; And still we drive
south, close-hauled on the wind, toward the inhospitable tip of
the continent.&nbsp; To-day we are south of a line drawn between
the Straits of Magellan and the Falklands, and to-morrow, if the
breeze holds, we shall pick up the coast of Tierra del Fuego
close to the entrance of the Straits of Le Maire, through which
Captain West intends to pass if the wind favours.</p>
<p>The other episode occurred last night.&nbsp; Mr. Pike says
nothing, yet he knows the crew situation.&nbsp; I have been
watching some time now, ever since the death of Marinkovich; and
I am certain that Mr. Pike never ventures on the main deck after
dark.&nbsp; Yet he holds his tongue, confides in no man, and
plays out the bitter perilous game as a commonplace matter of
course and all in the day&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>And now to the episode.&nbsp; Shortly after the close of the
second dog-watch last evening I went for&rsquo;ard to the
chickens on the &rsquo;midship-house on an errand for
Margaret.&nbsp; I was to make sure that the steward had carried
out her orders.&nbsp; The canvas covering to the big chicken coop
had to be down, the ventilation insured, and the kerosene stove
burning properly.&nbsp; When I had proved to my satisfaction the
dependableness of the steward, and just as I was on the verge of
returning to the poop, I was drawn aside by the weird crying of
penguins in the darkness and by the unmistakable noise of a whale
blowing not far away.</p>
<p>I had climbed around the end of the port boat, and was
standing there, quite hidden in the darkness, when I heard the
unmistakable age-lag step of the mate proceed along the bridge
from the poop.&nbsp; It was a dim starry night, and the
<i>Elsinore</i>, in the calm ocean under the lee of Tierra del
Fuego, was slipping gently and prettily through the water at an
eight-knot clip.</p>
<p>Mr. Pike paused at the for&rsquo;ard end of the housetop and
stood in a listening attitude.&nbsp; From the main deck below,
near Number Two hatch, across the mumbling of various voices, I
could recognize Kid Twist, Nosey Murphy, and Bert Rhine&mdash;the
three gangsters.&nbsp; But Steve Roberts, the cow-boy, was also
there, as was Mr. Mellaire, both of whom belonged in the other
watch and should have been turned in; for, at midnight, it would
be their watch on deck.&nbsp; Especially wrong was Mr.
Mellaire&rsquo;s presence, holding social converse with members
of the crew&mdash;a breach of ship ethics most grievous.</p>
<p>I have always been cursed with curiosity.&nbsp; Always have I
wanted to know; and, on the <i>Elsinore</i>, I have already
witnessed many a little scene that was a clean-cut dramatic
gem.&nbsp; So I did not discover myself, but lurked behind the
boat.</p>
<p>Five minutes passed.&nbsp; Ten minutes passed.&nbsp; The men
still talked.&nbsp; I was tantalized by the crying of the
penguins, and by the whale, evidently playful, which came so
close that it spouted and splashed a biscuit-toss away.&nbsp; I
saw Mr. Pike&rsquo;s head turn at the sound; he glanced squarely
in my direction, but did not see me.&nbsp; Then he returned to
listening to the mumble of voices from beneath.</p>
<p>Now whether Mulligan Jacobs just happened along, or whether he
was deliberately scouting, I do not know.&nbsp; I tell what
occurred.&nbsp; Up-and-down the side of the &rsquo;midship-house
is a ladder.&nbsp; And up this ladder Mulligan Jacobs climbed so
noiselessly that I was not aware of his presence until I heard
Mr. Pike snarl:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the hell you doin&rsquo; here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I saw Mulligan Jacobs in the gloom, within two yards of
the mate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s it to you?&rdquo; Mulligan Jacobs snarled
back.&nbsp; The voices below hushed.&nbsp; I knew every man stood
there tense and listening.&nbsp; No; the philosophers have not
yet explained Mulligan Jacobs.&nbsp; There is something more to
him than the last word has said in any book.&nbsp; He stood there
in the darkness, a fragile creature with curvature of the spine,
facing alone the first mate, and he was not afraid.</p>
<p>Mr. Pike cursed him with fearful, unrepeatable words, and
again demanded what he was doing there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I left me plug of tobacco here when I was coiling down
last,&rdquo; said the little twisted man&mdash;no; he did not say
it.&nbsp; He spat it out like so much venom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get off of here, or I&rsquo;ll throw you off, you and
your tobacco,&rdquo; raged the mate.</p>
<p>Mulligan Jacobs lurched closer to Mr. Pike, and in the gloom
and with the roll of the ship swayed in the other&rsquo;s
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By God, Jacobs!&rdquo; was all the mate could say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You old stiff,&rdquo; was all the terrible little
cripple could retort.</p>
<p>Mr. Pike gripped him by the collar and swung him in the
air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you goin&rsquo; down?&mdash;or am I goin&rsquo; to
throw you down?&rdquo; the mate demanded.</p>
<p>I cannot describe their manner of utterance.&nbsp; It was that
of wild beasts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t ate outa your hand yet, have I?&rdquo;
was the reply.</p>
<p>Mr. Pike tried to say something, still holding the cripple
suspended, but he could do no more than strangle in his impotence
of rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re an old stiff, an old stiff, an old
stiff,&rdquo; Mulligan Jacobs chanted, equally incoherent and
unimaginative with brutish fury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say it again and over you go,&rdquo; the mate managed
to enunciate thickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re an old stiff,&rdquo; gasped Mulligan
Jacobs.&nbsp; He was flung.&nbsp; He soared through the air with
the might of the fling, and even as he soared and fell through
the darkness he reiterated:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old stiff!&nbsp; Old stiff!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He fell among the men on Number Two hatch, and there were
confusion and movement below, and groans.</p>
<p>Mr. Pike paced up and down the narrow house and gritted his
teeth.&nbsp; Then he paused.&nbsp; He leaned his arms on the
bridge-rail, rested his head on his arms for a full minute, then
groaned:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.&rdquo;&nbsp; That
was all.&nbsp; Then he went aft, slowly, dragging his feet along
the bridge.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>
<p>The days grow gray.&nbsp; The sun has lost its warmth, and
each noon, at meridian, it is lower in the northern sky.&nbsp;
All the old stars have long since gone, and it would seem the sun
is following them.&nbsp; The world&mdash;the only world I
know&mdash;has been left behind far there to the north, and the
hill of the earth is between it and us.&nbsp; This sad and
solitary ocean, gray and cold, is the end of all things, the
falling-off place where all things cease.&nbsp; Only it grows
colder, and grayer, and penguins cry in the night, and huge
amphibians moan and slubber, and great albatrosses, gray with
storm-battling of the Horn, wheel and veer.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;Land ho!&rdquo; was the cry yesterday morning.&nbsp; I
shivered as I gazed at this, the first land since Baltimore a few
centuries ago.&nbsp; There was no sun, and the morning was damp
and cold with a brisk wind that penetrated any garment.&nbsp; The
deck thermometer marked 30&mdash;two degrees below
freezing-point; and now and then easy squalls of snow swept
past.</p>
<p>All of the land that was to be seen was snow.&nbsp; Long, low
chains of peaks, snow-covered, arose out of the ocean.&nbsp; As
we drew closer, there were no signs of life.&nbsp; It was a
sheer, savage, bleak, forsaken land.&nbsp; By eleven, off the
entrance of Le Maire Straits, the squalls ceased, the wind
steadied, and the tide began to make through in the direction we
desired to go.</p>
<p>Captain West did not hesitate.&nbsp; His orders to Mr. Pike
were quick and tranquil.&nbsp; The man at the wheel altered the
course, while both watches sprang aloft to shake out royals and
skysails.&nbsp; And yet Captain West knew every inch of the risk
he took in this graveyard of ships.</p>
<p>When we entered the narrow strait, under full sail and gripped
by a tremendous tide, the rugged headlands of Tierra del Fuego
dashed by with dizzying swiftness.&nbsp; Close we were to them,
and close we were to the jagged coast of Staten Island on the
opposite shore.&nbsp; It was here, in a wild bight, between two
black and precipitous walls of rock where even the snow could
find no lodgment, that Captain West paused in a casual sweep of
his glasses and gazed steadily at one place.&nbsp; I picked the
spot up with my own glasses and was aware of an instant chill as
I saw the four masts of a great ship sticking out of the
water.&nbsp; Whatever craft it was, it was as large as the
<i>Elsinore</i>, and it had been but recently wrecked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the German nitrate ships,&rdquo; said Mr.
Pike.&nbsp; Captain West nodded, still studying the wreck, then
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;She looks quite deserted.&nbsp; Just the same, Mr.
Pike, send several of your best-sighted sailors aloft, and keep a
good lookout yourself.&nbsp; There may be some survivors ashore
trying to signal us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But we sailed on, and no signals were seen.&nbsp; Mr. Pike was
delighted with our good fortune.&nbsp; He was guilty of walking
up and down, rubbing his hands and chuckling to himself.&nbsp;
Not since 1888, he told me, had he been through the Straits of Le
Maire.&nbsp; Also, he said that he knew of shipmasters who had
made forty voyages around the Horn and had never once had the
luck to win through the straits.&nbsp; The regular passage is far
to the east around Staten Island, which means a loss of westing,
and here, at the tip of the world, where the great west wind,
unobstructed by any land, sweeps round and around the narrow
girth of earth, westing is the thing that has to be fought for
mile by mile and inch by inch.&nbsp; The Sailing Directions
advise masters on the Horn passage: <i>Make Westing</i>.&nbsp;
<i>Whatever you do</i>, <i>make westing</i>.</p>
<p>When we emerged from the straits in the early afternoon the
same steady breeze continued, and in the calm water under the lee
of Tierra del Fuego, which extends south-westerly to the Horn, we
slipped along at an eight-knot clip.</p>
<p>Mr. Pike was beside himself.&nbsp; He could scarcely tear
himself from the deck when it was his watch below.&nbsp; He
chuckled, rubbed his hands, and incessantly hummed snatches from
the Twelfth Mass.&nbsp; Also, he was voluble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow morning we&rsquo;ll be up with the
Horn.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll shave it by a dozen or fifteen
miles.&nbsp; Think of it!&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll just steal
around!&nbsp; I never had such luck, and never expected to.&nbsp;
Old girl <i>Elsinore</i>, you&rsquo;re rotten for&rsquo;ard, but
the hand of God is at your helm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once, under the weather cloth, I came upon him talking to
himself.&nbsp; It was more a prayer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only she don&rsquo;t pipe up,&rdquo; he kept
repeating.&nbsp; &ldquo;If only she don&rsquo;t pipe
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Mellaire was quite different.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It never happens,&rdquo; he told me.&nbsp; &ldquo;No
ship ever went around like this.&nbsp; You watch her come.&nbsp;
She always comes a-smoking out of the sou&rsquo;west.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But can&rsquo;t a vessel ever steal around?&rdquo; I
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The odds are mighty big against it, sir,&rdquo; he
answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a line on them.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll wager even, sir, just a nominal bet of a pound of
tobacco, that inside twenty-four hours we&rsquo;ll he hove to
under upper-topsails.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll wager ten pounds to five
that we&rsquo;re not west of the Horn a week from now; and, fifty
to fifty being the passage, twenty pounds to five that two weeks
from now we&rsquo;re not up with fifty in the Pacific.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As for Captain West, the perils of Le Maire behind, he sat
below, his slippered feet stretched before him, smoking a
cigar.&nbsp; He had nothing to say whatever, although Margaret
and I were jubilant and dared duets through all of the second
dog-watch.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>And this morning, in a smooth sea and gentle breeze, the Horn
bore almost due north of us not more than six miles away.&nbsp;
Here we were, well abreast and reeling off westing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What price tobacco this morning?&rdquo; I quizzed Mr.
Mellaire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going up,&rdquo; he came back.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wish I had
a thousand bets like the one with you, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I glanced about at sea and sky and gauged the speed of our way
by the foam, but failed to see anything that warranted his
remark.&nbsp; It was surely fine weather, and the steward, in
token of the same, was trying to catch fluttering Cape pigeons
with a bent pin on a piece of thread.</p>
<p>For&rsquo;ard, on the poop, I encountered Mr. Pike.&nbsp; It
<i>was</i> an encounter, for his salutation was a grunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re going right along,&rdquo; I ventured
cheerily.</p>
<p>He made no reply, but turned and stared into the gray
south-west with an expression sourer than any I had ever seen on
his face.&nbsp; He mumbled something I failed to catch, and, on
my asking him to repeat it, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s breeding weather.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t you see
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I shook my head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye think we&rsquo;re taking off the kites
for?&rdquo; he growled.</p>
<p>I looked aloft.&nbsp; The skysails were already furled; men
were furling the royals; and the topgallant-yards were running
down while clewlines and buntlines bagged the canvas.&nbsp; Yet,
if anything, our northerly breeze fanned even more gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless me if I can see any weather,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then go and take a look at the barometer,&rdquo; he
grunted, as he turned on his heel and swung away from me.</p>
<p>In the chart-room was Captain West, pulling on his long
sea-boots.&nbsp; That would have told me had there been no
barometer, though the barometer was eloquent enough of
itself.&nbsp; The night before it had stood at 30.10.&nbsp; It
was now 28.64.&nbsp; Even in the pampero it had not been so low
as that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The usual Cape Horn programme,&rdquo; Captain West
smiled to me, as he stood up in all his lean and slender
gracefulness and reached for his long oilskin coat.</p>
<p>Still I could scarcely believe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it very far away?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>He shook his head, and forebore in the act of speaking to lift
his hand for me to listen.&nbsp; The <i>Elsinore</i> rolled
uneasily, and from without came the soft and hollow thunder of
sails emptying themselves against the masts and gear.</p>
<p>We had chatted a bare five minutes, when again he lifted his
head.&nbsp; This time the <i>Elsinore</i> heeled over slightly
and remained heeled over, while the sighing whistle of a rising
breeze awoke in the rigging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s beginning to make,&rdquo; he said, in the
good old Anglo-Saxon of the sea.</p>
<p>And then I heard Mr. Pike snarling out orders, and in my heart
discovered a growing respect for Cape Horn&mdash;Cape Stiff, as
the sailors call it.</p>
<p>An hour later we were hove to on the port tack under
upper-topsails and foresail.&nbsp; The wind had come out of the
south-west, and our leeway was setting us down upon the
land.&nbsp; Captain West gave orders to the mate to stand by to
wear ship.&nbsp; Both watches had been taking in sail, so that
both watches were on deck for the manoeuvre.</p>
<p>It was astounding, the big sea that had arisen in so short a
time.&nbsp; The wind was blowing a gale that ever, in recurring
gusts, increased upon itself.&nbsp; Nothing was visible a hundred
yards away.&nbsp; The day had become black-gray.&nbsp; In the
cabin lamps were burning.&nbsp; The view from the poop, along the
length of the great labouring ship, was magnificent.&nbsp; Seas
burst and surged across her weather-rail and kept her deck half
filled, despite the spouting ports and gushing scuppers.</p>
<p>On each of the two houses and on the poop the ship&rsquo;s
complement, all in oilskins, was in groups.&nbsp; For&rsquo;ard,
Mr. Mellaire had charge.&nbsp; Mr. Pike took charge of the
&rsquo;midship-house and the poop.&nbsp; Captain West strolled up
and down, saw everything, said nothing; for it was the
mate&rsquo;s affair.</p>
<p>When Mr. Pike ordered the wheel hard up, he slacked off all
the mizzen-yards, and followed it with a partial slacking of the
main-yards, so that the after-pressures were eased.&nbsp; The
foresail and fore-lower- and-upper-topsails remained flat in
order to pay the head off before the wind.&nbsp; All this took
time.&nbsp; The men were slow, not strong, and without
snap.&nbsp; They reminded me of dull oxen by the way they moved
and pulled.&nbsp; And the gale, ever snorting harder, now snorted
diabolically.&nbsp; Only at intervals could I glimpse the group
on top the for&rsquo;ard-house.&nbsp; Again and again, leaning to
it and holding their heads down, the men on the
&rsquo;midship-house were obliterated by the drive of crested
seas that burst against the rail, spouted to the lower-yards, and
swept in horizontal volumes across to leeward.&nbsp; And Mr.
Pike, like an enormous spider in a wind-tossed web, went back and
forth along the slender bridge that was itself a shaken thread in
the blast of the storm.</p>
<p>So tremendous were the gusts that for the time the
<i>Elsinore</i> refused to answer.&nbsp; She lay down to it; she
was swept and racked by it; but her head did not pay off before
it, and all the while we drove down upon that bitter, iron
coast.&nbsp; And the world was black-gray, and violent, and very
cold, with the flying spray freezing to ice in every
lodgment.</p>
<p>We waited.&nbsp; The groups of men, head down to it,
waited.&nbsp; Mr. Pike, restless, angry, his blue eyes as bitter
as the cold, his mouth as much a-snarl as the snarl of the
elements with which he fought, waited.&nbsp; The Samurai waited,
tranquil, casual, remote.&nbsp; And Cape Horn waited, there on
our lee, for the bones of our ship and us.</p>
<p>And then the <i>Elsinore&rsquo;s</i> bow paid off.&nbsp; The
angle of the beat of the gale changed, and soon, with dreadful
speed, we were dashing straight before it and straight toward the
rocks we could not see.&nbsp; But all doubt was over.&nbsp; The
success of the manoeuvre was assured.&nbsp; Mr. Mellaire,
informed by messenger along the bridge from Mr. Pike, slacked off
the head-yards.&nbsp; Mr. Pike, his eye on the helmsman, his hand
signalling the order, had the wheel put over to port to check the
<i>Elsinore&rsquo;s</i> rush into the wind as she came up on the
starboard tack.&nbsp; All was activity.&nbsp; Main- and
mizzen-yards were braced up, and the <i>Elsinore</i>, snugged
down and hove to, had a lee of thousands of miles of Southern
Ocean.</p>
<p>And all this had been accomplished in the stamping ground of
storm, at the end of the world, by a handful of wretched
weaklings, under the drive of two strong mates, with behind them
the placid will of the Samurai.</p>
<p>It had taken thirty minutes to wear ship, and I had learned
how the best of shipmasters can lose their ships without
reproach.&nbsp; Suppose the <i>Elsinore</i> had persisted in her
refusal to payoff?&nbsp; Suppose anything had carried away?&nbsp;
And right here enters Mr. Pike.&nbsp; It is his task ever to see
that every rope and block and all the myriad other things in the
vast and complicated gear of the <i>Elsinore</i> are in strength
not to carry away.&nbsp; Always have the masters of our race
required henchmen like Mr. Pike, and it seems the race has well
supplied those henchmen.</p>
<p>Ere I went below I heard Captain West tell Mr. Pike that while
both watches were on deck it would be just as well to put a reef
in the foresail before they furled it.&nbsp; The mainsail and the
crojack being off, I could see the men black on the
fore-yard.&nbsp; For half-an-hour I lingered, watching
them.&nbsp; They seemed to make no progress with the reef.&nbsp;
Mr. Mellaire was with them, having direct supervision of the job,
while Mr. Pike, on the poop, growled and grumbled and spat
endless blasphemies into the flying air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two watches on a single yardarm and unable to put a
reef in a handkerchief like that!&rdquo; he snorted.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll it be if we&rsquo;re off here a
month?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A month!&rdquo; I cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A month isn&rsquo;t anything for Cape Stiff,&rdquo; he
said grimly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been off here seven weeks
and then turned tail and run around the other way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Around the world?&rdquo; I gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the only way to get to &rsquo;Frisco,&rdquo; he
answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Horn&rsquo;s the Horn, and
there&rsquo;s no summer seas that I&rsquo;ve ever noticed in this
neighbourhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My fingers were numb and I was chilled through when I took a
last look at the wretched men on the fore-yard and went below to
warm up.</p>
<p>A little later, as I went in to table, through a cabin port I
stole a look for&rsquo;ard between seas and saw the men still
struggling on the freezing yard.</p>
<p>The four of us were at table, and it was very comfortable, in
spite of the <i>Elsinore&rsquo;s</i> violent antics.&nbsp; The
room was warm.&nbsp; The storm-racks on the table kept each dish
in its place.&nbsp; The steward served and moved about with ease
and apparent unconcern, although I noticed an occasional anxious
gleam in his eyes when he poised some dish at a moment when the
ship pitched and flung with unusual wildness.</p>
<p>And now and again I thought of the poor devils on the
yard.&nbsp; Well, they belonged there by right, just as we
belonged here by right in this oasis of the cabin.&nbsp; I looked
at Mr. Pike and wagered to myself that half-a-dozen like him
could master that stubborn foresail.&nbsp; As for the Samurai, I
was convinced that alone, not moving from his seat, by a tranquil
exertion of will, he could accomplish the same thing.</p>
<p>The lighted sea-lamps swung and leaped in their gimbals, ever
battling with the dancing shadows in the murky gray.&nbsp; The
wood-work creaked and groaned.&nbsp; The jiggermast, a huge
cylinder of hollow steel that perforated the apartment through
deck above and floor beneath, was hideously vocal with the
storm.&nbsp; Far above, taut ropes beat against it so that it
clanged like a boiler-shop.&nbsp; There was a perpetual thunder
of seas falling on our deck and crash of water against our
for&rsquo;ard wall; while the ten thousand ropes and gears aloft
bellowed and screamed as the storm smote them.</p>
<p>And yet all this was from without.&nbsp; Here, at this
well-appointed table, was no draught nor breath of wind, no drive
of spray nor wash of sea.&nbsp; We were in the heart of peace in
the midmost centre of the storm.&nbsp; Margaret was in high
spirits, and her laughter vied with the clang of the
jiggermast.&nbsp; Mr. Pike was gloomy, but I knew him well enough
to attribute his gloom, not to the elements, but to the
inefficients futilely freezing on the yard.&nbsp; As for me, I
looked about at the four of us&mdash;blue-eyed, gray-eyed, all
fair-skinned and royal blond&mdash;and somehow it seemed that I
had long since lived this, and that with me and in me were all my
ancestors, and that their lives and memories were mine, and that
all this vexation of the sea and air and labouring ship was of
old time and a thousand times before.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>
<p>&ldquo;How are you for a climb?&rdquo; Margaret asked me,
shortly after we had left the table.</p>
<p>She stood challengingly at my open door, in oilskins,
sou&rsquo;wester, and sea-boots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen you with a foot above the deck
since we sailed,&rdquo; she went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you a good
head?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I marked my book, rolled out of my bunk in which I had been
wedged, and clapped my hands for Wada.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you?&rdquo; she cried eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you let me lead,&rdquo; I answered airily,
&ldquo;and if you will promise to hold on tight.&nbsp; Whither
away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Into the top of the jigger.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the
easiest.&nbsp; As for holding on, please remember that I have
often done it.&nbsp; It is with you the doubt rests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; I retorted; &ldquo;do you lead
then.&nbsp; I shall hold on tight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen many a landsman funk it,&rdquo; she
teased.&nbsp; &ldquo;There are no lubber-holes in our
tops.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And most likely I shall,&rdquo; I agreed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been aloft in my life, and since there is
no hole for a lubber.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at me, half believing my confession of weakness,
while I extended my arms for the oilskin which Wada struggled on
to me.</p>
<p>On the poop it was magnificent, and terrible, and
sombre.&nbsp; The universe was very immediately about us.&nbsp;
It blanketed us in storming wind and flying spray and
grayness.&nbsp; Our main deck was impassable, and the relief of
the wheel came aft along the bridge.&nbsp; It was two
o&rsquo;clock, and for over two hours the frozen wretches had
laid out upon the fore-yard.&nbsp; They were still there, weak,
feeble, hopeless.&nbsp; Captain West, stepping out in the lee of
the chart-house, gazed at them for several minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to give up that reef,&rdquo; he said
to Mr. Pike.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just make the sail fast.&nbsp; Better
put on double gaskets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with lagging feet, from time to time pausing and holding
on as spray and the tops of waves swept over him, the mate went
for&rsquo;ard along the bridge to vent his scorn on the two
watches of a four-masted ship that could not reef a foresail.</p>
<p>It is true.&nbsp; They could not do it, despite their
willingness, for this I have learned: <i>the men do their weak
best whenever the order is given to shorten sail</i>.&nbsp; It
must be that they are afraid.&nbsp; They lack the iron of Mr.
Pike, the wisdom and the iron of Captain West.&nbsp; Always, have
I noticed, with all the alacrity of which they are capable, do
they respond to any order to shorten down.&nbsp; That is why they
are for&rsquo;ard, in that pigsty of a forecastle, because they
lack the iron.&nbsp; Well, I can say only this: If nothing else
could have prevented the funk hinted at by Margaret, the sorry
spectacle of these ironless, spineless creatures was sufficient
safeguard.&nbsp; How could I funk in the face of their
weakness&mdash;I, who lived aft in the high place?</p>
<p>Margaret did not disdain the aid of my hand as she climbed
upon the pin-rail at the foot of the weather
jigger-rigging.&nbsp; But it was merely the recognition of a
courtesy on her part, for the next moment she released her
mittened hand from mine, swung boldly outboard into the face of
the gale, and around against the ratlines.&nbsp; Then she began
to climb.&nbsp; I followed, almost unaware of the ticklishness of
the exploit to a tyro, so buoyed up was I by her example and by
my scorn of the weaklings for&rsquo;ard.&nbsp; Where men could
go, I could go.&nbsp; What men could do, I could do.&nbsp; And no
daughter of the Samurai could out-game me.</p>
<p>Yet it was slow work.&nbsp; In the windward rolls against the
storm-gusts one was pinned helplessly, like a butterfly, against
the rigging.&nbsp; At such times, so great was the pressure one
could not lift hand nor foot.&nbsp; Also, there was no need for
holding on.&nbsp; As I have said, one was pinned against the
rigging by the wind.</p>
<p>Through the snow beginning to drive the deck grew small
beneath me, until a fall meant a broken back or death, unless one
landed in the sea, in which case the result would be frigid
drowning.&nbsp; And still Margaret climbed.&nbsp; Without pause
she went out under the overhanging platform of the top, shifted
her holds to the rigging that went aloft from it, and swung
around this rigging, easily, carelessly, timing the action to the
roll, and stood safely upon the top.</p>
<p>I followed.&nbsp; I breathed no prayers, knew no qualms, as I
presented my back to the deck and climbed out under the overhang,
feeling with my hands for holds I could not see.&nbsp; I was in
an ecstasy.&nbsp; I could dare anything.&nbsp; Had she sprung
into the air, stretched out her arms, and soared away on the
breast of the gale, I should have unhesitatingly followed
her.</p>
<p>As my head outpassed the edge of the top so that she came into
view, I could see she was looking at me with storm-bright
eyes.&nbsp; And as I swung around the rigging lightly and joined
her, I saw approval in her eyes that was quickly routed by
petulance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ve done this sort of thing before,&rdquo;
she reproached, calling loudly, so that I might hear, her lips
close to my ear.</p>
<p>I shook a denial with my head that brightened her eyes
again.&nbsp; She nodded and smiled, and sat down, dangling her
sea-boots into snow-swirled space from the edge of the top.&nbsp;
I sat beside her, looking down into the snow that hid the deck
while it exaggerated the depth out of which we had climbed.</p>
<p>We were all alone there, a pair of storm petrels perched in
mid air on a steel stick that arose out of snow and that vanished
above into snow.&nbsp; We had come to the tip of the world, and
even that tip had ceased to be.&nbsp; But no.&nbsp; Out of the
snow, down wind, with motionless wings, driving fully eighty or
ninety miles an hour, appeared a huge albatross.&nbsp; He must
have been fifteen feet from wing-tip to wing-tip.&nbsp; He had
seen his danger ere we saw him, and, tilting his body on the
blast, he carelessly veered clear of collision.&nbsp; His head
and neck were rimed with age or frost&mdash;we could not tell
which&mdash;and his bright bead-eye noted us as he passed and
whirled away on a great circle into the snow to leeward.</p>
<p>Margaret&rsquo;s hand shot out to mine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It alone was worth the climb!&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp;
And then the <i>Elsinore</i> flung down, and Margaret&rsquo;s
hand clutched tighter for holding, while from the hidden depths
arose the crash and thunder of the great west wind drift upon our
decks.</p>
<p>Quickly as the snow-squall had come, it passed with the same
sharp quickness, and as in a flash we could see the lean length
of the ship beneath us&mdash;the main deck full with boiling
flood, the forecastle-head buried in a bursting sea, the lookout,
stationed for very life back on top the for&rsquo;ard-house,
hanging on, head down, to the wind-drive of ocean, and, directly
under us, the streaming poop and Mr. Mellaire, with a handful of
men, rigging relieving tackles on the tiller.&nbsp; And we saw
the Samurai emerge in the lee of the chart-house, swaying with
casual surety on the mad deck, as he spoke what must have been
instructions to Mr. Pike.</p>
<p>The gray circle of the world had removed itself from us for
several hundred yards, and we could see the mighty sweep of
sea.&nbsp; Shaggy gray-beards, sixty feet from trough to crest,
leapt out of the windward murky gray, and in unending procession
rushed upon the <i>Elsinore</i>, one moment overtoppling her
slender frailness, the next moment splashing a hundred tons of
water on her deck and flinging her skyward as they passed beneath
and foamed and crested from sight in the murky gray to
leeward.&nbsp; And the great albatrosses veered and circled about
us, beating up into the bitter violence of the gale and sweeping
grandly away before it far faster than it blew.</p>
<p>Margaret forbore from looking to challenge me with eloquent,
questioning eyes.&nbsp; With numb fingers inside my thick mitten,
I drew aside the ear-flap of her sou&rsquo;wester and
shouted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is nothing new.&nbsp; I have been here before.&nbsp;
In the lives of all my fathers have I been here.&nbsp; The frost
is on my cheek, the salt bites my nostrils, the wind chants in my
ears, and it is an old happening.&nbsp; I know, now, that my
forbears were Vikings.&nbsp; I was seed of them in their own
day.&nbsp; With them I have raided English coasts, dared the
Pillars of Hercules, forayed the Mediterranean, and sat in the
high place of government over the soft sun-warm peoples.&nbsp; I
am Hengist and Horsa; I am of the ancient heroes, even legendary
to them.&nbsp; I have bearded and bitten the frozen seas, and,
aforetime of that, ere ever the ice-ages came to be, I have
dripped my shoulders in reindeer gore, slain the mastodon and the
sabre-tooth, scratched the record of my prowess on the walls of
deep-buried caves&mdash;ay, and suckled she-wolves side by side
with my brother-cubs, the scars of whose fangs are now upon
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed deliciously, and a snow-squall drove upon us and
cut our cheeks, and the <i>Elsinore</i> flung over and down as if
she would never rise again, while we held on and swept through
the air in a dizzying arc.&nbsp; Margaret released a hand, still
laughing, and pressed aside my ear-flap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about it,&rdquo; she
cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;It sounds like poetry.&nbsp; But I believe
it.&nbsp; It has to be, for it has been.&nbsp; I have heard it
aforetime, when skin-clad men sang in fire-circles that pressed
back the frost and night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the books?&rdquo; she queried maliciously, as we
prepared to descend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They can go hang, along with all the brain-sick,
world-sick fools that wrote them,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>Again she laughed deliciously, though the wind tore the sound
away as she swung out into space, muscled herself by her arms
while she caught footholds beneath her which she could not see,
and passed out of my sight under the perilous overhang of the
top.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXV</h2>
<p>&ldquo;What price tobacco?&rdquo; was Mr. Mellaire&rsquo;s
greeting, when I came on deck this morning, bruised and weary,
aching in every bone and muscle from sixty hours of being tossed
about.</p>
<p>The wind had fallen to a dead calm toward morning, and the
Elsinore, her several spread sails booming and slatting, rolled
more miserably than ever.&nbsp; Mr. Mellaire pointed
for&rsquo;ard of our starboard beam.&nbsp; I could make out a
bleak land of white and jagged peaks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Staten Island, the easterly end of it,&rdquo; said Mr.
Mellaire.</p>
<p>And I knew that we were in the position of a vessel just
rounding Staten Island preliminary to bucking the Horn.&nbsp;
And, yet, four days ago, we had run through the Straits of Le
Maire and stolen along toward the Horn.&nbsp; Three days ago we
had been well abreast of the Horn and even a few miles
past.&nbsp; And here we were now, starting all over again and far
in the rear of where we had originally started.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>The condition of the men is truly wretched.&nbsp; During the
gale the forecastle was washed out twice.&nbsp; This means that
everything in it was afloat and that every article of clothing,
including mattresses and blankets, is wet and will remain wet in
this bitter weather until we are around the Horn and well up in
the good-weather latitudes.&nbsp; The same is true of the
&rsquo;midship-house.&nbsp; Every room in it, with the exception
of the cook&rsquo;s and the sail-makers&rsquo; (which open
for&rsquo;ard on Number Two hatch), is soaking.&nbsp; And they
have no fires in their rooms with which to dry things out.</p>
<p>I peeped into Charles Davis&rsquo;s room.&nbsp; It was
terrible.&nbsp; He grinned to me and nodded his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just as well O&rsquo;Sullivan wasn&rsquo;t
here, sir,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;d a-drowned in
the lower bunk.&nbsp; And I want to tell you I was doing some
swimmin&rsquo; before I could get into the top one.&nbsp; And
salt water&rsquo;s bad for my sores.&nbsp; I oughtn&rsquo;t to be
in a hole like this in Cape Horn weather.&nbsp; Look at the ice,
there, on the floor.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s below freezin&rsquo; right
now in this room, and my blankets are wet, and I&rsquo;m a sick
man, as any man can tell that&rsquo;s got a nose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;d been decent to the mate you might have
got decent treatment in return,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; he sneered.&nbsp; &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t
think you can lose me, sir.&nbsp; I can grow fat on this sort of
stuff.&nbsp; Why, sir, when I think of the court doin&rsquo;s in
Seattle I just couldn&rsquo;t die.&nbsp; An&rsquo; if
you&rsquo;ll listen to me, sir, you&rsquo;ll cover the
steward&rsquo;s money.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t lose.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m advisin&rsquo; you, sir, because you&rsquo;re a sort of
decent sort.&nbsp; Anybody that bets on my going over the side is
a sure loser.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could you dare ship on a voyage like this in your
condition?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Condition?&rdquo; he queried with a fine assumption of
innocence.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, that is why I did ship.&nbsp; I was
in tiptop shape when I sailed.&nbsp; All this come out on me
afterward.&nbsp; You remember seem&rsquo; me aloft, an&rsquo; up
to my neck in water.&nbsp; And I trimmed coal below, too.&nbsp; A
sick man couldn&rsquo;t do it.&nbsp; And remember, sir,
you&rsquo;ll have to testify to how I did my duty at the
beginning before I took down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet with you myself if you think I&rsquo;m
goin&rsquo; to die,&rdquo; he called after me.</p>
<p>Already the sailors show marks of the hardship they are
enduring.&nbsp; It is surprising, in so short a time, how lean
their faces have grown, how lined and seamed.&nbsp; They must dry
their underclothing with their body heat.&nbsp; Their outer
garments, under their oilskins, are soggy.&nbsp; And yet,
paradoxically, despite their lean, drawn faces, they have grown
very stout.&nbsp; Their walk is a waddle, and they bulge with
seaming corpulency.&nbsp; This is due to the amount of clothing
they have on.&nbsp; I noticed Larry, to-day, had on two vests,
two coats, and an overcoat, with his oilskin outside of
that.&nbsp; They are elephantine in their gait for, in addition
to everything else, they have wrapped their feet, outside their
sea-boots, with gunny sacking.</p>
<p>It <i>is</i> cold, although the deck thermometer stood at
thirty-three to-day at noon.&nbsp; I had Wada weigh the clothing
I wear on deck.&nbsp; Omitting oilskins and boots, it came to
eighteen pounds.&nbsp; And yet I am not any too warm in all this
gear when the wind is blowing.&nbsp; How sailors, after having
once experienced the Horn, can ever sign on again for a voyage
around is beyond me.&nbsp; It but serves to show how stupid they
must be.</p>
<p>I feel sorry for Henry, the training-ship boy.&nbsp; He is
more my own kind, and some day he will make a henchman of the
afterguard and a mate like Mr. Pike.&nbsp; In the meantime, along
with Buckwheat, the other boy who berths in the
&rsquo;midship-house with him, he suffers the same hardship as
the men.&nbsp; He is very fair-skinned, and I noticed this
afternoon, when he was pulling on a brace, that the sleeves of
his oil-skins, assisted by the salt water, have chafed his wrists
till they are raw and bleeding and breaking out in
sea-boils.&nbsp; Mr. Mellaire tells me that in another week there
will be a plague of these boils with all hands for&rsquo;ard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When do you think we&rsquo;ll be up with the Horn
again?&rdquo; I innocently queried of Mr. Pike.</p>
<p>He turned upon me in a rage, as if I had insulted him, and
positively snarled in my face ere he swung away without the
courtesy of an answer.&nbsp; It is evident that he takes the sea
seriously.&nbsp; That is why, I fancy, he is so excellent a
seaman.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>The days pass&mdash;if the interval of sombre gray that comes
between the darknesses can be called day.&nbsp; For a week, now,
we have not seen the sun.&nbsp; Our ship&rsquo;s position in this
waste of storm and sea is conjectural.&nbsp; Once, by dead
reckoning, we gained up with the Horn and a hundred miles south
of it.&nbsp; And then came another sou&rsquo;west gale that tore
our fore-topsail and brand new spencer out of the belt-ropes and
swept us away to a conjectured longitude east of Staten
Island.</p>
<p>Oh, I know now this Great West Wind that blows for ever around
the world south of 55.&nbsp; And I know why the chart-makers have
capitalized it, as, for instance, when I read &ldquo;The Great
West Wind Drift.&rdquo;&nbsp; And I know why the <i>Sailing
Directions</i> advise: &ldquo;<i>Whatever you do</i>, <i>make
westing</i>! <i>make westing</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the West Wind and the drift of the West Wind will not
permit the <i>Elsinore</i> to make westing.&nbsp; Gale follows
gale, always from the west, and we make easting.&nbsp; And it is
bitter cold, and each gale snorts up with a prelude of driving
snow.</p>
<p>In the cabin the lamps burn all day long.&nbsp; No more does
Mr. Pike run the phonograph, nor does Margaret ever touch the
piano.&nbsp; She complains of being bruised and sore.&nbsp; I
have a wrenched shoulder from being hurled against the
wall.&nbsp; And both Wada and the steward are limping.&nbsp;
Really, the only comfort I can find is in my bunk, so wedged with
boxes and pillows that the wildest rolls cannot throw me
out.&nbsp; There, save for my meals and for an occasional run on
deck for exercise and fresh air, I lie and read eighteen and
nineteen hours out of the twenty-four.&nbsp; But the unending
physical strain is very wearisome.</p>
<p>How it must be with the poor devils for&rsquo;ard is beyond
conceiving.&nbsp; The forecastle has been washed out several
times, and everything is soaking wet.&nbsp; Besides, they have
grown weaker, and two watches are required to do what one
ordinary watch could do.&nbsp; Thus, they must spend as many
hours on the sea-swept deck and aloft on the freezing yards as I
do in my warm, dry bunk.&nbsp; Wada tells me that they never
undress, but turn into their wet bunks in their oil-skins and
sea-boots and wet undergarments.</p>
<p>To look at them crawling about on deck or in the rigging is
enough.&nbsp; They are truly weak.&nbsp; They are gaunt-cheeked
and haggard-gray of skin, with great dark circles under their
eyes.&nbsp; The predicted plague of sea-boils and sea-cuts has
come, and their hands and wrists and arms are frightfully
afflicted.&nbsp; Now one, and now another, and sometimes several,
either from being knocked down by seas or from general
miserableness, take to the bunk for a day or so off.&nbsp; This
means more work for the others, so that the men on their feet are
not tolerant of the sick ones, and a man must be very sick to
escape being dragged out to work by his mates.</p>
<p>I cannot but marvel at Andy Fay and Mulligan Jacobs.&nbsp; Old
and fragile as they are, it seems impossible that they can endure
what they do.&nbsp; For that matter, I cannot understand why they
work at all.&nbsp; I cannot understand why any of them toil on
and obey an order in this freezing hell of the Horn.&nbsp; Is it
because of fear of death that they do not cease work and bring
death to all of us?&nbsp; Or is it because they are slave-beasts,
with a slave-psychology, so used all their lives to being driven
by their masters that it is beyond their mental power to refuse
to obey?</p>
<p>And yet most of them, in a week after we reach Seattle, will
be on board other ships outward bound for the Horn.&nbsp;
Margaret says the reason for this is that sailors forget.&nbsp;
Mr. Pike agrees.&nbsp; He says give them a week in the south-east
trades as we run up the Pacific and they will have forgotten that
they have ever been around the Horn.&nbsp; I wonder.&nbsp; Can
they be as stupid as this?&nbsp; Does pain leave no record with
them?&nbsp; Do they fear only the immediate thing?&nbsp; Have
they no horizons wider than a day?&nbsp; Then indeed do they
belong where they are.</p>
<p>They <i>are</i> cowardly.&nbsp; This was shown conclusively
this morning at two o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Never have I witnessed
such panic fear, and it was fear of the immediate
thing&mdash;fear, stupid and beast-like.&nbsp; It was Mr.
Mellaire&rsquo;s watch.&nbsp; As luck would have it, I was
reading Boas&rsquo;s <i>Mind of Primitive Man</i> when I heard
the rush of feet over my head.&nbsp; The <i>Elsinore</i> was hove
to on the port tack at the time, under very short canvas.&nbsp; I
was wondering what emergency had brought the watch upon the poop,
when I heard another rush of feet that meant the second
watch.&nbsp; I heard no pulling and hauling, and the thought of
mutiny flashed across my mind.</p>
<p>Still nothing happened, and, growing curious, I got into my
sea-boots, sheepskin coat, and oilskin, put on my
sou&rsquo;wester and mittens, and went on deck.&nbsp; Mr. Pike
had already dressed and was ahead of me.&nbsp; Captain West, who
in this bad weather sleeps in the chart-room, stood in the lee
doorway of the house, through which the lamplight streamed on the
frightened faces of the men.</p>
<p>Those of the &rsquo;midship-house were not present, but every
man Jack of the forecastle, with the exception of Andy Fay and
Mulligan Jacobs, as I afterwards learned, had joined in the
flight aft.&nbsp; Andy Fay, who belonged in the watch below, had
calmly remained in his bunk, while Mulligan Jacobs had taken
advantage of the opportunity to sneak into the forecastle and
fill his pipe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter, Mr. Pike?&rdquo; Captain West
asked.</p>
<p>Before the mate could reply, Bert Rhine snickered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The devil&rsquo;s come aboard, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But his snicker was palpably an assumption of unconcern he did
not possess.&nbsp; The more I think over it the more I am
surprised that such keen men as the gangsters should have been
frightened by what had occurred.&nbsp; But frightened they were,
the three of them, out of their bunks and out of the precious
surcease of their brief watch below.</p>
<p>So fear-struck was Larry that he chattered and grimaced like
an ape, and shouldered and struggled to get away from the dark
and into the safety of the shaft of light that shone out of the
chart-house.&nbsp; Tony, the Greek, was just as bad, mumbling to
himself and continually crossing himself.&nbsp; He was joined in
this, as a sort of chorus, by the two Italians, Guido Bombini and
Mike Cipriani.&nbsp; Arthur Deacon was almost in collapse, and he
and Chantz, the Jew, shamelessly clung to each other for
support.&nbsp; Bob, the fat and overgrown youth, was sobbing,
while the other youth, Bony the Splinter, was shivering and
chattering his teeth.&nbsp; Yes, and the two best sailors
for&rsquo;ard, Tom Spink and the Maltese Cockney, stood in the
background, their backs to the dark, their faces yearning toward
the light.</p>
<p>More than all other contemptible things in this world there
are two that I loathe and despise: hysteria in a woman; fear and
cowardice in a man.&nbsp; The first turns me to ice.&nbsp; I
cannot sympathize with hysteria.&nbsp; The second turns my
stomach.&nbsp; Cowardice in a man is to me positively
nauseous.&nbsp; And this fear-smitten mass of human animals on
our reeling poop raised my gorge.&nbsp; Truly, had I been a god
at that moment, I should have annihilated the whole mass of
them.&nbsp; No; I should have been merciful to one.&nbsp; He was
the Faun.&nbsp; His bright, pain-liquid, and flashing-eager eyes
strained from face to face with desire to understand.&nbsp; He
did not know what had occurred, and, being stone-deaf, had
thought the rush aft a response to a call for all hands.</p>
<p>I noticed Mr. Mellaire.&nbsp; He may be afraid of Mr. Pike,
and he is a murderer; but at any rate he has no fear of the
supernatural.&nbsp; With two men above him in authority, although
it was his watch, there was no call for him to do anything.&nbsp;
He swayed back and forth in balance to the violent motions of the
<i>Elsinore</i> and looked on with eyes that were amused and
cynical.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does the devil look like, my man?&rdquo; Captain
West asked.</p>
<p>Bert Rhine grinned sheepishly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Answer the captain!&rdquo; Mr. Pike snarled at him.</p>
<p>Oh, it was murder, sheer murder, that leapt into the
gangster&rsquo;s eyes for the instant, in acknowledgment of the
snarl.&nbsp; Then he replied to Captain West:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t wait to see, sir.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s
one whale of a devil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s as big as a elephant, sir,&rdquo;
volunteered Bill Quigley.&nbsp; &ldquo;I seen&rsquo;m face to
face, sir.&nbsp; He almost got me when I run out of the
fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;s&rsquo;le.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Lord, sir!&rdquo; Larry moaned.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
way he hit the house, sir.&nbsp; It was the call to
Judgment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your theology is mixed, my man,&rdquo; Captain West
smiled quietly, though I could not help seeing how tired was his
face and how tired were his wonderful Samurai eyes.</p>
<p>He turned to the mate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Pike, will you please go for&rsquo;ard and
interview this devil?&nbsp; Fasten him up and tie him down and
I&rsquo;ll take a look at him in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Pike; and Kipling&rsquo;s
line came to me:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Woman, Man, or God or Devil, was there
anything we feared?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And as I went for&rsquo;ard through the wall of darkness after
Mr. Pike and Mr. Mellaire along the freezing, slender, sea-swept
bridge&mdash;not a sailor dared to accompany us&mdash;other lines
of &ldquo;The Galley Slave&rdquo; drifted through my brain, such
as:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Our bulkheads bulged with cotton and our
masts were stepped in gold&mdash;<br />
We ran a mighty merchandise of niggers in the hold. . .
&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;By the brand upon my shoulder, by the gall
of clinging steel,<br />
By the welts the whips have left me, by the scars that never heal
. . . &rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Battered chain-gangs of the orlop, grizzled
draughts of years gone by . . . &rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I caught my great, radiant vision of Mr. Pike, galley
slave of the race, and a driver of men under men greater than he;
the faithful henchman, the able sailorman, battered and grizzled,
branded and galled, the servant of the sweep-head that made
mastery of the sea.&nbsp; I know him now.&nbsp; He can never
again offend me.&nbsp; I forgive him everything&mdash;the whiskey
raw on his breath the day I came aboard at Baltimore, his
moroseness when sea and wind do not favour, his savagery to the
men, his snarl and his sneer.</p>
<p>On top the &rsquo;midship-house we got a ducking that makes me
shiver to recall.&nbsp; I had dressed too hastily properly to
fasten my oilskin about my neck, so that I was wet to the
skin.&nbsp; We crossed the next span of bridge through driving
spray, and were well upon the top of the for&rsquo;ard-house when
something adrift on the deck hit the for&rsquo;ard wall a
terrific smash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever it is, it&rsquo;s playing the devil,&rdquo;
Mr. Pike yelled in my ear, as he endeavoured to locate the thing
by the dry-battery light-stick which he carried.</p>
<p>The pencil of light travelled over dark water, white with
foam, that churned upon the deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There it goes!&rdquo; Mr. Pike cried, as the
<i>Elsinore</i> dipped by the head and hurtled the water
for&rsquo;ard.</p>
<p>The light went out as the three of us caught holds and
crouched to a deluge of water from overside.&nbsp; As we emerged,
from under the forecastle-head we heard a tremendous thumping and
battering.&nbsp; Then, as the bow lifted, for an instant in the
pencil of light that immediately lost it, I glimpsed a vague
black object that bounded down the inclined deck where no water
was.&nbsp; What became of it we could not see.</p>
<p>Mr. Pike descended to the deck, followed by Mr.
Mellaire.&nbsp; Again, as the <i>Elsinore</i> dipped by the head
and fetched a surge of sea-water from aft along the runway, I saw
the dark object bound for&rsquo;ard directly at the mates.&nbsp;
They sprang to safety from its charge, the light went out, while
another icy sea broke aboard.</p>
<p>For a time I could see nothing of the two men.&nbsp; Next, in
the light flashed from the stick, I guessed that Mr. Pike was in
pursuit of the thing.&nbsp; He evidently must have captured it at
the rail against the starboard rigging and caught a turn around
it with a loose end of rope.&nbsp; As the vessel rolled to
windward some sort of a struggle seemed to be going on.&nbsp; The
second mate sprang to the mate&rsquo;s assistance, and, together,
with more loose ends, they seemed to subdue the thing.</p>
<p>I descended to see.&nbsp; By the light-stick we made it out to
be a large, barnacle-crusted cask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s been afloat for forty years,&rdquo; was Mr.
Pike&rsquo;s judgment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look at the size of the
barnacles, and look at the whiskers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s full of something,&rdquo; said Mr.
Mellaire.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hope it isn&rsquo;t water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I rashly lent a hand when they started to work the cask
for&rsquo;ard, between seas and taking advantage of the rolls and
pitches, to the shelter under the forecastle-head.&nbsp; As a
result, even through my mittens, I was cut by the sharp edges of
broken shell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s liquor of some sort,&rdquo; said the mate,
&ldquo;but we won&rsquo;t risk broaching it till
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where did it come from?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over the side&rsquo;s the only place it could have come
from.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Pike played the light over it.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Look at it!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s been afloat for years and
years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The stuff ought to be well-seasoned,&rdquo; commented
Mr. Mellaire.</p>
<p>Leaving them to lash the cask securely, I stole along the deck
to the forecastle and peered in.&nbsp; The men, in their headlong
flight, had neglected to close the doors, and the place was
afloat.&nbsp; In the flickering light from a small and very smoky
sea-lamp it was a dismal picture.&nbsp; No self-respecting
cave-man, I am sure, would have lived in such a hole.</p>
<p>Even as I looked a bursting sea filled the runway between the
house and rail, and through the doorway in which I stood the
freezing water rushed waist-deep.&nbsp; I had to hold on to
escape being swept inside the room.&nbsp; From a top bunk, lying
on his side, Andy Fay regarded me steadily with his bitter blue
eyes.&nbsp; Seated on the rough table of heavy planks, his
sea-booted feet swinging in the water, Mulligan Jacobs pulled at
his pipe.&nbsp; When he observed me he pointed to pulpy
book-pages that floated about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me library&rsquo;s gone to hell,&rdquo; he mourned as
he indicated the flotsam.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s me
Byron.&nbsp; An&rsquo; there goes Zola an&rsquo; Browning with a
piece of Shakespeare runnin&rsquo; neck an&rsquo; neck, an&rsquo;
what&rsquo;s left of <i>Anti-Christ</i> makin&rsquo; a bad
last.&nbsp; An&rsquo; there&rsquo;s Carlyle and Zola that cheek
by jowl you can&rsquo;t tell &rsquo;em apart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the <i>Elsinore</i> lay down to starboard, and the water
in the forecastle poured out against my legs and hips.&nbsp; My
wet mittens slipped on the iron work, and I swept down the runway
into the scuppers, where I was turned over and over by another
flood that had just boarded from windward.</p>
<p>I know I was rather confused, and that I had swallowed quite a
deal of salt water, ere I got my hands on the rungs of the ladder
and climbed to the top of the house.&nbsp; On my way aft along
the bridge I encountered the crew coming for&rsquo;ard.&nbsp; Mr.
Mellaire and Mr. Pike were talking in the lee of the chart-house,
and inside, as I passed below, Captain West was smoking a
cigar.</p>
<p>After a good rub down, in dry pyjamas, I was scarcely back in
my bunk with the <i>Mind of Primitive Man</i> before me, when the
stampede over my head was repeated.&nbsp; I waited for the second
rush.&nbsp; It came, and I proceeded to dress.</p>
<p>The scene on the poop duplicated the previous one, save that
the men were more excited, more frightened.&nbsp; They were
babbling and chattering all together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; Mr. Pike was snarling when I came upon
them.&nbsp; &ldquo;One at a time, and answer the captain&rsquo;s
question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t no barrel this time, sir,&rdquo; Tom
Spink said.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s alive.&nbsp; An&rsquo; if it
ain&rsquo;t the devil it&rsquo;s the ghost of a drownded
man.&nbsp; I see &rsquo;m plain an&rsquo; clear.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s
a man, or was a man once&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They was two of &rsquo;em, sir,&rdquo; Richard Giller,
one of the &ldquo;bricklayers,&rdquo; broke in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he looked like Petro Marinkovich, sir,&rdquo;
Tom Spink went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; the other was Jespersen&mdash;I seen
&rsquo;m,&rdquo; Giller added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They was three of &rsquo;em, sir,&rdquo; said Nosey
Murphy.&nbsp; &ldquo;O&rsquo;Sullivan, sir, was the other
one.&nbsp; They ain&rsquo;t devils, sir.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re
drownded men.&nbsp; They come aboard right over the bows,
an&rsquo; they moved slow like drownded men.&nbsp; Sorensen seen
the first one first.&nbsp; He caught my arm an&rsquo; pointed,
an&rsquo; then I seen &rsquo;m.&nbsp; He was on top the
for&rsquo;ard-house.&nbsp; And Olansen seen &rsquo;m, an&rsquo;
Deacon, sir, an&rsquo; Hackey.&nbsp; We all seen &rsquo;m, sir .
. . an&rsquo; the second one; an&rsquo; when the rest run away I
stayed long enough to see the third one.&nbsp; Mebbe
there&rsquo;s more.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t wait to see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain West stopped the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Pike,&rdquo; he said wearily, &ldquo;will you
straighten this nonsense out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; Mr. Pike responded, then turned on the
man.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come on, all of you!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s three
devils to tie down this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the men shrank away from the order and from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For two cents . . . &rdquo; I heard Mr. Pike growl to
himself, then choke off utterance.</p>
<p>He flung about on his heel and started for the bridge.&nbsp;
In the same order as on the previous trip, Mr. Mellaire second,
and I bringing up the rear, we followed.&nbsp; It was a similar
journey, save that we caught a ducking midway on the first span
of bridge as well as a ducking on the &rsquo;midship-house.</p>
<p>We halted on top the for&rsquo;ard-house.&nbsp; In vain Mr.
Pike flashed his light-stick.&nbsp; Nothing was to be seen nor
heard save the white-flecked dark water on our deck, the roar of
the gale in our rigging, and the crash and thunder of seas
falling aboard.&nbsp; We advanced half-way across the last span
of bridge to the fore-castle head, and were driven to pause and
hang on at the foremast by a bursting sea.</p>
<p>Between the drives of spray Mr. Pike flashed his stick.&nbsp;
I heard him exclaim something.&nbsp; Then he went on to the
forecastle-head, followed by Mr. Mellaire, while I waited by the
foremast, clinging tight, and endured another ducking.&nbsp;
Through the emergencies I could see the pencil of light,
appearing and disappearing, darting here and there.&nbsp; Several
minutes later the mates were back with me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Half our head-gear&rsquo;s carried away,&rdquo; Mr.
Pike told me.&nbsp; &ldquo;We must have run into
something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I felt a jar, right after you&rsquo; went below, sir,
last time,&rdquo; said Mr. Mellaire.&nbsp; &ldquo;Only I thought
it was a thump of sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So did I feel it,&rdquo; the mate agreed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I was just taking off my boots.&nbsp; I thought it was a
sea.&nbsp; But where are the three devils?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Broaching the cask,&rdquo; the second mate
suggested.</p>
<p>We made the forecastle-head, descended the iron ladder, and
went for&rsquo;ard, inside, underneath, out of the wind and
sea.&nbsp; There lay the cask, securely lashed.&nbsp; The size of
the barnacles on it was astonishing.&nbsp; They were as large as
apples and inches deep.&nbsp; A down-fling of bow brought a foot
of water about our boots; and as the bow lifted and the water
drained away, it drew out from the shell-crusted cask streamers
of seaweed a foot or so in length.</p>
<p>Led by Mr. Pike and watching our chance between seas, we
searched the deck and rails between the forecastle-head and the
for&rsquo;ard-house and found no devils.&nbsp; The mate stepped
into the forecastle doorway, and his light-stick cut like a
dagger through the dim illumination of the murky sea-lamp.&nbsp;
And we saw the devils.&nbsp; Nosey Murphy had been right.&nbsp;
There were three of them.</p>
<p>Let me give the picture: A drenched and freezing room of
rusty, paint-scabbed iron, low-roofed, double-tiered with bunks,
reeking with the filth of thirty men, despite the washing of the
sea.&nbsp; In a top bunk, on his side, in sea-boots and oilskins,
staring steadily with blue, bitter eyes, Andy Fay; on the table,
pulling at a pipe, with hanging legs dragged this way and that by
the churn of water, Mulligan Jacobs, solemnly regarding three
men, sea-booted and bloody, who stand side by side, of a height
and not duly tall, swaying in unison to the
<i>Elsinore&rsquo;s</i> down-flinging and up-lifting.</p>
<p>But such men!&nbsp; I know my East Side and my East End, and I
am accustomed to the faces of all the ruck of races, yet with
these three men I was at fault.&nbsp; The Mediterranean had
surely never bred such a breed; nor had Scandinavia.&nbsp; They
were not blonds.&nbsp; They were not brunettes.&nbsp; Nor were
they of the Brown, or Black, or Yellow.&nbsp; Their skin was
white under a bronze of weather.&nbsp; Wet as was their hair, it
was plainly a colourless, sandy hair.&nbsp; Yet their eyes were
dark&mdash;and yet not dark.&nbsp; They were neither blue, nor
gray, nor green, nor hazel.&nbsp; Nor were they black.&nbsp; They
were topaz, pale topaz; and they gleamed and dreamed like the
eyes of great cats.&nbsp; They regarded us like walkers in a
dream, these pale-haired storm-waifs with pale, topaz eyes.&nbsp;
They did not bow, they did not smile, in no way did they
recognize our presence save that they looked at us and
dreamed.</p>
<p>But Andy Fay greeted us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a hell of a night an&rsquo; not a wink of
sleep with these goings-on,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now where did they blow in from a night like
this?&rdquo; Mulligan Jacobs complained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got a tongue in your mouth,&rdquo; Mr.
Pike snarled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why ain&rsquo;t you asked
&rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As though you didn&rsquo;t know I could use the tongue
in me mouth, you old stiff,&rdquo; Jacobs snarled back.</p>
<p>But it was no time for their private feud.&nbsp; Mr. Pike
turned on the dreaming new-comers and addressed them in the
mangled and aborted phrases of a dozen languages such as the
world-wandering Anglo-Saxon has had every opportunity to learn
but is too stubborn-brained and wilful-mouthed to wrap his tongue
about.</p>
<p>The visitors made no reply.&nbsp; They did not even shake
their heads.&nbsp; Their faces remained peculiarly relaxed and
placid, incurious and pleasant, while in their eyes floated
profounder dreams.&nbsp; Yet they were human.&nbsp; The blood of
their injuries stained them and clotted on their clothes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dutchmen,&rdquo; snorted Mr. Pike, with all due
contempt for other breeds, as he waved them to make themselves at
home in any of the bunks.</p>
<p>Mr. Pike&rsquo;s ethnology is narrow.&nbsp; Outside his own
race he is aware of only three races: niggers, Dutchmen, and
Dagoes.</p>
<p>Again our visitors proved themselves human.&nbsp; They
understood the mate&rsquo;s invitation, and, glancing first at
one another, they climbed into three top-bunks and closed their
eyes.&nbsp; I could swear the first of them was asleep in half a
minute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to clean up for&rsquo;ard, or
we&rsquo;ll be having the sticks about our ears,&rdquo; the mate
said, already starting to depart.&nbsp; &ldquo;Get the men along,
Mr. Mellaire, and call out the carpenter.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI</h2>
<p>And no westing!&nbsp; We have been swept back three degrees of
casting since the night our visitors came on board.&nbsp; They
are the great mystery, these three men of the sea.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Horn Gypsies,&rdquo; Margaret calls them; and Mr. Pike
dubs them &ldquo;Dutchmen.&rdquo;&nbsp; One thing is certain,
they have a language of their own which they talk with one
another.&nbsp; But of our hotch-potch of nationalities fore and
aft there is no person who catches an inkling of their language
or nationality.</p>
<p>Mr. Mellaire raised the theory that they were Finns of some
sort, but this was indignantly denied by our big-footed youth of
a carpenter, who swears he is a Finn himself.&nbsp; Louis, the
cook, avers that somewhere over the world, on some forgotten
voyage, he has encountered men of their type; but he can neither
remember the voyage nor their race.&nbsp; He and the rest of the
Asiatics accept their presence as a matter of course; but the
crew, with the exception of Andy Fay and Mulligan Jacobs, is very
superstitious about the new-comers, and will have nothing to do
with them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No good will come of them, sir,&rdquo; Tom Spink, at
the wheel, told us, shaking his head forebodingly.</p>
<p>Margaret&rsquo;s mittened hand rested on my arm as we balanced
to the easy roll of the ship.&nbsp; We had paused from our
promenade, which we now take each day, religiously, as a
constitutional, between eleven and twelve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what is the matter with them?&rdquo; she queried,
nudging me privily in warning of what was coming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because they ain&rsquo;t men, Miss, as we can rightly
call men.&nbsp; They ain&rsquo;t regular men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a bit irregular, their manner of coming on
board,&rdquo; she gurgled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it, Miss,&rdquo; Tom Spink exclaimed,
brightening perceptibly at the hint of understanding.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;d they come from?&nbsp; They won&rsquo;t
tell.&nbsp; Of course they won&rsquo;t tell.&nbsp; They
ain&rsquo;t men.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re spirits&mdash;ghosts of
sailors that drowned as long ago as when that cask went adrift
from a sinkin&rsquo; ship, an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s years an&rsquo;
years, Miss, as anybody can see, lookin&rsquo; at the size of the
barnacles on it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; Margaret queried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We all think so, Miss.&nbsp; We ain&rsquo;t spent our
lives on the sea for nothin&rsquo;.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no end of
landsmen don&rsquo;t believe in the Flyin&rsquo; Dutchman.&nbsp;
But what do they know?&nbsp; They&rsquo;re just landsmen,
ain&rsquo;t they?&nbsp; They ain&rsquo;t never had their leg
grabbed by a ghost, such as I had, on the <i>Kathleen</i>,
thirty-five years ago, down in the hole &rsquo;tween the
water-casks.&nbsp; An&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t that ghost rip the shoe
right off of me?&nbsp; An&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t I fall through the
hatch two days later an&rsquo; break my shoulder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Miss, I seen &rsquo;em makin&rsquo; signs to Mr.
Pike that we&rsquo;d run into their ship hove to on the other
tack.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you believe it.&nbsp; There wasn&rsquo;t
no ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how do you explain the carrying away of our
head-gear?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s lots of things can&rsquo;t be explained,
sir,&rdquo; was Tom Spink&rsquo;s answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who can
explain the way the Finns plays tom-fool tricks with the
weather?&nbsp; Yet everybody knows it.&nbsp; Why are we
havin&rsquo; a hard passage around the Horn, sir?&nbsp; I ask you
that.&nbsp; Why, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I shook my head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because of the carpenter, sir.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve found
out he&rsquo;s a Finn.&nbsp; Why did he keep it quiet all the way
down from Baltimore?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did he tell it?&rdquo; Margaret challenged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t tell it, Miss&mdash;leastways, not
until after them three others boarded us.&nbsp; I got my
suspicions he knows more about &rsquo;m than he&rsquo;s
lettin&rsquo; on.&nbsp; An&rsquo; look at the weather an&rsquo;
the delay we&rsquo;re gettin&rsquo;.&nbsp; An&rsquo; don&rsquo;t
everybody know the Finns is regular warlocks an&rsquo;
weather-breeders?&rdquo;</p>
<p>My ears pricked up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you get that word <i>warlock</i>?&rdquo; I
questioned.</p>
<p>Tom Spink looked puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with it, sir?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all right.&nbsp; But where
did you get it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never got it, sir.&nbsp; I always had it.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s what Finns is&mdash;warlocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And these three new-comers&mdash;they aren&rsquo;t
Finns?&rdquo; asked Margaret.</p>
<p>The old Englishman shook his head solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Miss.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re drownded sailors a long
time drownded.&nbsp; All you have to do is look at
&rsquo;m.&nbsp; An&rsquo; the carpenter could tell us a few if he
was minded.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Nevertheless, our mysterious visitors are a welcome addition
to our weakened crew.&nbsp; I watch them at work.&nbsp; They are
strong and willing.&nbsp; Mr. Pike says they are real sailormen,
even if he doesn&rsquo;t understand their lingo.&nbsp; His theory
is that they are from some small old-country or outlander ship,
which, hove to on the opposite tack to the <i>Elsinore</i>, was
run down and sunk.</p>
<p>I have forgotten to say that we found the barnacled cask
nearly filled with a most delicious wine which none of us can
name.&nbsp; As soon as the gale moderated Mr. Pike had the cask
brought aft and broached, and now the steward and Wada have it
all in bottles and spare demijohns.&nbsp; It is beautifully aged,
and Mr. Pike is certain that it is some sort of a mild and
unheard-of brandy.&nbsp; Mr. Mellaire merely smacks his lips over
it, while Captain West, Margaret, and I steadfastly maintain that
it is wine.</p>
<p>The condition of the men grows deplorable.&nbsp; They were
always poor at pulling on ropes, but now it takes two or three to
pull as much as one used to pull.&nbsp; One thing in their favour
is that they are well, though grossly, fed.&nbsp; They have all
they want to eat, such as it is, but it is the cold and wet, the
terrible condition of the forecastle, the lack of sleep, and the
almost continuous toil of both watches on deck.&nbsp; Either
watch is so weak and worthless that any severe task requires the
assistance of the other watch.&nbsp; As an instance, we finally
managed a reef in the foresail in the thick of a gale.&nbsp; It
took both watches two hours, yet Mr. Pike tells me that under
similar circumstances, with an average crew of the old days, he
has seen a single watch reef the foresail in twenty minutes.</p>
<p>I have learned one of the prime virtues of a steel
sailing-ship.&nbsp; Such a craft, heavily laden, does not strain
her seams open in bad weather and big seas.&nbsp; Except for a
tiny leak down in the fore-peak, with which we sailed from
Baltimore and which is bailed out with a pail once in several
weeks, the <i>Elsinore</i> is bone-dry.&nbsp; Mr. Pike tells me
that had a wooden ship of her size and cargo gone through the
buffeting we have endured, she would be leaking like a sieve.</p>
<p>And Mr. Mellaire, out of his own experience, has added to my
respect for the Horn.&nbsp; When he was a young man he was once
eight weeks in making around from 50 in the Atlantic to 50 in the
Pacific.&nbsp; Another time his vessel was compelled to put back
twice to the Falklands for repairs.&nbsp; And still another time,
in a wooden ship running back in distress to the Falklands, his
vessel was lost in a shift of gale in the very entrance to Port
Stanley.&nbsp; As he told me:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And after we&rsquo;d been there a month, sir, who
should come in but the old <i>Lucy Powers</i>.&nbsp; She was a
sight!&mdash;her foremast clean gone out of her and half her
spars, the old man killed from one of the spars falling on him,
the mate with two broken arms, the second mate sick, and what was
left of the crew at the pumps.&nbsp; We&rsquo;d lost our ship, so
my skipper took charge, refitted her, doubled up both crews, and
we headed the other way around, pumping two hours in every watch
clear to Honolulu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poor wretched chickens!&nbsp; Because of their ill-judged
moulting they are quite featherless.&nbsp; It is a marvel that
one of them survives, yet so far we have lost only six.&nbsp;
Margaret keeps the kerosene stove going, and, though they have
ceased laying, she confidently asserts that they are all layers
and that we shall have plenty of eggs once we get fine weather in
the Pacific.</p>
<p>There is little use to describe these monotonous and perpetual
westerly gales.&nbsp; One is very like another, and they follow
so fast on one another&rsquo;s heels that the sea never has a
chance to grow calm.&nbsp; So long have we rolled and tossed
about that the thought, say, of a solid, unmoving billiard-table
is inconceivable.&nbsp; In previous incarnations I have
encountered things that did not move, but . . . they were in
previous incarnations.</p>
<p>We have been up to the Diego Ramirez Rocks twice in the past
ten days.&nbsp; At the present moment, by vague dead reckoning,
we are two hundred miles east of them.&nbsp; We have been hove
down to our hatches three times in the last week.&nbsp; We have
had six stout sails, of the heaviest canvas, furled and
double-gasketed, torn loose and stripped from the yards.&nbsp;
Sometimes, so weak are our men, not more than half of them can
respond to the call for all hands.</p>
<p>Lars Jacobson, who had his leg broken early in the voyage, was
knocked down by a sea several days back and had the leg
rebroken.&nbsp; Ditman Olansen, the crank-eyed Norwegian, went
Berserker last night in the second dog-watch and pretty well
cleaned out his half of the forecastle.&nbsp; Wada reports that
it required the bricklayers, Fitzgibbon and Gilder, the Maltese
Cockney, and Steve Roberts, the cowboy, finally to subdue the
madman.&nbsp; These are all men of Mr. Mellaire&rsquo;s
watch.&nbsp; In Mr. Pike&rsquo;s watch John Hackey, the San
Francisco hoodlum, who has stood out against the gangsters, has
at last succumbed and joined them.&nbsp; And only this morning
Mr. Pike dragged Charles Davis by the scruff of the neck out of
the forecastle, where he had caught him expounding sea-law to the
miserable creatures.&nbsp; Mr. Mellaire, I notice on occasion,
remains unduly intimate with the gangster clique.&nbsp; And yet
nothing serious happens.</p>
<p>And Charles Davis does not die.&nbsp; He seems actually to be
gaining in weight.&nbsp; He never misses a meal.&nbsp; From the
break of the poop, in the shelter of the weather cloth, our decks
a thunder and rush of freezing water, I often watch him slip out
of his room between seas, mug and plate in hand, and hobble
for&rsquo;ard to the galley for his food.&nbsp; He is a keen
judge of the ship&rsquo;s motions, for never yet have I seen him
get a serious ducking.&nbsp; Sometimes, of course, he may get
splattered with spray or wet to the knees, but he manages to be
out of the way whenever a big graybeard falls on board.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII</h2>
<p>A wonderful event to-day!&nbsp; For five minutes, at noon, the
sun was actually visible.&nbsp; But such a sun!&mdash;a pale and
cold and sickly orb that at meridian was only 90 degrees 18
minutes above the horizon.&nbsp; And within the hour we were
taking in sail and lying down to the snow-gusts of a fresh
south-west gale.</p>
<p><i>Whatever you do</i>, <i>make westing</i>! <i>make
westing</i>!&mdash;this sailing rule of the navigators for the
Horn has been bitten out of iron.&nbsp; I can understand why
shipmasters, with a favouring slant of wind, have left sailors,
fallen overboard, to drown without heaving-to to lower a
boat.&nbsp; Cape Horn is iron, and it takes masters of iron to
win around from east to west.</p>
<p>And we make easting!&nbsp; This west wind is eternal.&nbsp; I
listen incredulously when Mr. Pike or Mr. Mellaire tells of times
when easterly winds have blown in these latitudes.&nbsp; It is
impossible.&nbsp; Always does the west wind blow, gale upon gale
and gales everlasting, else why the &ldquo;Great West Wind
Drift&rdquo; printed on the charts!&nbsp; We of the afterguard
are weary of this eternal buffeting.&nbsp; Our men have become
pulpy, washed-out, sore-corroded shadows of men.&nbsp; I should
not be surprised, in the end, to see Captain West turn tail and
run eastward around the world to Seattle.&nbsp; But Margaret
smiles with surety, and nods her head, and affirms that her
father will win around to 50 in the Pacific.</p>
<p>How Charles Davis survives in that wet, freezing,
paint-scabbed room of iron in the &rsquo;midship-house is beyond
me&mdash;just as it is beyond me that the wretched sailors in the
wretched forecastle do not lie down in their bunks and die, or,
at least, refuse to answer the call of the watches.</p>
<p>Another week has passed, and we are to-day, by observation,
sixty miles due south of the Straits of Le Maire, and we are
hove-to, in a driving gale, on the port tack.&nbsp; The glass is
down to 28.58, and even Mr. Pike acknowledges that it is one of
the worst Cape Horn snorters he has ever experienced.</p>
<p>In the old days the navigators used to strive as far south as
64 degrees or 65 degrees, into the Antarctic drift ice, hoping,
in a favouring spell, to make westing at a prodigious rate across
the extreme-narrowing wedges of longitude.&nbsp; But of late
years all shipmasters have accepted the hugging of the land all
the way around.&nbsp; Out of ten times ten thousand passages of
Cape Stiff from east to west, this, they have concluded, is the
best strategy.&nbsp; So Captain West hugs the land.&nbsp; He
heaves-to on the port tack until the leeward drift brings the
land into perilous proximity, then wears ship and heaves-to on
the port tack and makes leeway off shore.</p>
<p>I may be weary of all this bitter movement of a labouring ship
on a frigid sea, but at the same time I do not mind it.&nbsp; In
my brain burns the flame of a great discovery and a great
achievement.&nbsp; I have found what makes all the books go
glimmering; I have achieved what my very philosophy tells me is
the greatest achievement a man can make.&nbsp; I have found the
love of woman.&nbsp; I do not know whether she cares for
me.&nbsp; Nor is that the point.&nbsp; The point is that in
myself I have risen to the greatest height to which the human
male animal can rise.</p>
<p>I know a woman and her name is Margaret.&nbsp; She is
Margaret, a woman and desirable.&nbsp; My blood is red.&nbsp; I
am not the pallid scholar I so proudly deemed myself to be.&nbsp;
I am a man, and a lover, despite the books.&nbsp; As for De
Casseres&mdash;if ever I get back to New York, equipped as I now
am, I shall confute him with the same ease that he has confuted
all the schools.&nbsp; Love is the final word.&nbsp; To the
rational man it alone gives the super-rational sanction for
living.&nbsp; Like Bergson in his overhanging heaven of
intuition, or like one who has bathed in Pentecostal fire and
seen the New Jerusalem, so I have trod the materialistic dictums
of science underfoot, scaled the last peak of philosophy, and
leaped into my heaven, which, after all, is within myself.&nbsp;
The stuff that composes me, that is I, is so made that it finds
its supreme realization in the love of woman.&nbsp; It is the
vindication of being.&nbsp; Yes, and it is the wages of being,
the payment in full for all the brittleness and frailty of flesh
and breath.</p>
<p>And she is only a woman, like any woman, and the Lord knows I
know what women are.&nbsp; And I know Margaret for what she
is&mdash;mere woman; and yet I know, in the lover&rsquo;s soul of
me, that she is somehow different.&nbsp; Her ways are not as the
ways of other women, and all her ways are delightful to me.&nbsp;
In the end, I suppose, I shall become a nest-builder, for of a
surety nest-building is one of her pretty ways.&nbsp; And who
shall say which is the worthier&mdash;the writing of a whole
library or the building of a nest?</p>
<p>The monotonous days, bleak and gray and soggy cold, drag
by.&nbsp; It is now a month since we began the passage of the
Horn, and here we are, not so well forward as a month ago,
because we are something like a hundred miles south of the
Straits of Le Maire.&nbsp; Even this position is conjectural,
being arrived at by dead reckoning, based on the leeway of a ship
hove-to, now on the one tack, now on the other, with always the
Great West Wind Drift making against us.&nbsp; It is four days
since our last instrument-sight of the sun.</p>
<p>This storm-vexed ocean has become populous.&nbsp; No ships are
getting round, and each day adds to our number.&nbsp; Never a
brief day passes without our sighting from two or three to a
dozen hove-to on port tack or starboard tack.&nbsp; Captain West
estimates there must be at least two hundred sail of us.&nbsp; A
ship hove-to with preventer tackles on the rudder-head is
unmanageable.&nbsp; Each night we take our chance of unavoidable
and disastrous collision.&nbsp; And at times, glimpsed through
the snow-squalls, we see and curse the ships, east-bound, that
drive past us with the West Wind and the West Wind Drift at their
backs.&nbsp; And so wild is the mind of man that Mr. Pike and Mr.
Mellaire still aver that on occasion they have known gales to
blow ships from east to west around the Horn.&nbsp; It surely has
been a year since we of the <i>Elsinore</i> emerged from under
the lee of Tierra Del Fuego into the snorting south-west
gales.&nbsp; A century, at least, has elapsed since we sailed
from Baltimore.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>And I don&rsquo;t give a snap of my fingers for all the wrath
and fury of this dim-gray sea at the tip of the earth.&nbsp; I
have told Margaret that I love her.&nbsp; The tale was told in
the shelter of the weather cloth, where we clung together in the
second dog-watch last evening.&nbsp; And it was told again, and
by both of us, in the bright-lighted chart-room after the watches
had been changed at eight bells.&nbsp; Yes, and her face was
storm-bright, and all of her was very proud, save that her eyes
were warm and soft and fluttered with lids that just would
flutter maidenly and womanly.&nbsp; It was a great hour&mdash;our
great hour.</p>
<p>A poor devil of a man is most lucky when, loving, he is
loved.&nbsp; Grievous indeed must be the fate of the lover who is
unloved.&nbsp; And I, for one, and for still other reasons,
congratulate myself upon the vastitude of my good fortune.&nbsp;
For see, were Margaret any other sort of a woman, were she . . .
well, just the lovely and lovable and adorably snuggly sort who
seem made just precisely for love and loving and nestling into
the strong arms of a man&mdash;why, there wouldn&rsquo;t be
anything remarkable or wonderful about her loving me.&nbsp; But
Margaret is Margaret, strong, self-possessed, serene, controlled,
a very mistress of herself.&nbsp; And there&rsquo;s the
miracle&mdash;that such a woman should have been awakened to love
by me.&nbsp; It is almost unbelievable.&nbsp; I go out of my way
to get another peep into those long, cool, gray eyes of hers and
see them grow melting soft as she looks at me.&nbsp; She is no
Juliet, thank the Lord; and thank the Lord I am no Romeo.&nbsp;
And yet I go up alone on the freezing poop, and under my breath
chant defiantly at the snorting gale, and at the graybeards
thundering down on us, that I am a lover.&nbsp; And I send
messages to the lonely albatrosses veering through the murk that
I am a lover.&nbsp; And I look at the wretched sailors crawling
along the spray-swept bridge and know that never in ten thousand
wretched lives could they experience the love I experience, and I
wonder why God ever made them.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the one thing I had firmly resolved from the
start,&rdquo; Margaret confessed to me this morning in the cabin,
when I released her from my arms, &ldquo;was that I would not
permit you to make love to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True daughter of Herodias,&rdquo; I gaily gibed,
&ldquo;so such was the drift of your thoughts even as early as
the very start.&nbsp; Already you were looking upon me with a
considerative female eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed proudly, and did not reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What possibly could have led you to expect that I would
make love to you?&rdquo; I insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because it is the way of young male passengers on long
voyages,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then others have . . . ?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They always do,&rdquo; she assured me gravely.</p>
<p>And at that instant I knew the first ridiculous pang of
jealousy; but I laughed it away and retorted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was an ancient Chinese philosopher who is first
recorded as having said, what doubtlessly the cave men before him
gibbered, namely, that a woman pursues a man by fluttering away
in advance of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wretch!&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never
fluttered.&nbsp; When did I ever flutter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a delicate subject . . . &rdquo; I began with
assumed hesitancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did I ever flutter?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>I availed myself of one of Schopenhauer&rsquo;s ruses by
making a shift.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the first you observed nothing that a female could
afford to miss observing,&rdquo; I charged.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wager you knew as quickly as I the very instant
when I first loved you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew the first time you hated me,&rdquo; she
evaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know, the first time I saw you and learned that
you were coming on the voyage,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
now I repeat my challenge.&nbsp; You knew as quickly as I the
first instant I loved you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh, her eyes were beautiful, and the repose and certitude of
her were tremendous, as she rested her hand on my arm for a
moment and in a low, quiet voice said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I . . . I think I know.&nbsp; It was the morning
of that pampero off the Plate, when you were thrown through the
door into my father&rsquo;s stateroom.&nbsp; I saw it in your
eyes.&nbsp; I knew it.&nbsp; I think it was the first time, the
very instant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could only nod my head and draw her close to me.&nbsp; And
she looked up at me and added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were very ridiculous.&nbsp; There you sat, on the
bed, holding on with one hand and nursing the other hand under
your arm, staring at me, irritated, startled, utterly foolish,
and then . . . how, I don&rsquo;t know . . . I knew that you had
just come to know . . . &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the very next instant you froze up,&rdquo; I
charged ungallantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that was why,&rdquo; she admitted shamelessly, then
leaned away from me, her hands resting on my shoulders, while she
gurgled and her lips parted from over her beautiful white
teeth.</p>
<p>One thing I, John Pathurst, know: that gurgling laughter of
hers is the most adorable laughter that was ever heard.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXVIII</h2>
<p>I wonder.&nbsp; I wonder.&nbsp; Did the Samurai make a
mistake?&nbsp; Or was it the darkness of oncoming death that
chilled and clouded that star-cool brain of his, and made a mock
of all his wisdom?&nbsp; Or was it the blunder that brought death
upon him beforehand?&nbsp; I do not know, I shall never know; for
it is a matter no one of us dreams of hinting at, much less
discussing.</p>
<p>I shall begin at the beginning&mdash;yesterday
afternoon.&nbsp; For it was yesterday afternoon, five weeks to a
day since we emerged from the Straits of Le Maire into this gray
storm-ocean, that once again we found ourselves hove to directly
off the Horn.&nbsp; At the changing of the watches at four
o&rsquo;clock, Captain West gave the command to Mr. Pike to wear
ship.&nbsp; We were on the starboard tack at the time, making
leeway off shore.&nbsp; This manoeuvre placed us on the port
tack, and the consequent leeway, to me, seemed on shore, though
at an acute angle, to be sure.</p>
<p>In the chart-room, glancing curiously at the chart, I measured
the distance with my eye and decided that we were in the
neighbourhood of fifteen miles off Cape Horn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With our drift we&rsquo;ll be close up under the land
by morning, won&rsquo;t we?&rdquo; I ventured tentatively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Captain West nodded; &ldquo;and if it
weren&rsquo;t for the West Wind Drift, and if the land did not
trend to the north-east, we&rsquo;d be ashore by morning.&nbsp;
As it is, we&rsquo;ll be well under it at daylight, ready to
steal around if there is a change, ready to wear ship if there is
no change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It did not enter my head to question his judgment.&nbsp; What
he said had to be.&nbsp; Was he not the Samurai?</p>
<p>And yet, a few minutes later, when he had gone below, I
noticed Mr. Pike enter the chart-house.&nbsp; After several paces
up and down, and a brief pause to watch Nancy and several men
shift the weather cloth from lee to weather, I strolled aft to
the chart-house.&nbsp; Prompted by I know not what, I peeped
through one of the glass ports.</p>
<p>There stood Mr. Pike, his sou&rsquo;wester doffed, his
oilskins streaming rivulets to the floor, while he, dividers and
parallel rulers in hand, bent over the chart.&nbsp; It was the
expression of his face that startled me.&nbsp; The habitual
sourness had vanished.&nbsp; All that I could see was anxiety and
apprehension . . . yes, and age.&nbsp; I had never seen him look
so old; for there, at that moment, I beheld the wastage and
weariness of all his sixty-nine years of sea-battling and
sea-staring.</p>
<p>I slipped away from the port and went along the deck to the
break of the poop, where I held on and stood staring through the
gray and spray in the conjectural direction of our drift.&nbsp;
Somewhere, there, in the north-east and north, I knew was a
broken, iron coast of rocks upon which the graybeards
thundered.&nbsp; And there, in the chart-room, a redoubtable
sailorman bent anxiously over a chart as he measured and
calculated, and measured and calculated again, our position and
our drift.</p>
<p>And I knew it could not be.&nbsp; It was not the Samurai but
the henchman who was weak and wrong.&nbsp; Age was beginning to
tell upon him at last, which could not be otherwise than expected
when one considered that no man in ten thousand had weathered age
so successfully as he.</p>
<p>I laughed at my moment&rsquo;s qualm of foolishness and went
below, well content to meet my loved one and to rest secure in
her father&rsquo;s wisdom.&nbsp; Of course he was right.&nbsp; He
had proved himself right too often already on the long voyage
from Baltimore.</p>
<p>At dinner Mr. Pike was quite distrait.&nbsp; He took no part
whatever in the conversation, and seemed always to be listening
to something from without&mdash;to the vexing clang of taut ropes
that came down the hollow jiggermast, to the muffled roar of the
gale in the rigging, to the smash and crash of the seas along our
decks and against our iron walls.</p>
<p>Again I found myself sharing his apprehension, although I was
too discreet to question him then, or afterwards alone, about his
trouble.&nbsp; At eight he went on deck again to take the watch
till midnight, and as I went to bed I dismissed all forebodings
and speculated as to how many more voyages he could last after
this sudden onslaught of old age.</p>
<p>I fell asleep quickly, and awoke at midnight, my lamp still
burning, Conrad&rsquo;s <i>Mirror of the Sea</i> on my breast
where it had dropped from my hands.&nbsp; I heard the watches
change, and was wide awake and reading when Mr. Pike came below
by the booby-hatch and passed down my hail by my open door, on
his way to his room.</p>
<p>In the pause I had long since learned so well I knew he was
rolling a cigarette.&nbsp; Then I heard him cough, as he always
did, when the cigarette was lighted and the first inhalation of
smoke flushed his lungs.</p>
<p>At twelve-fifteen, in the midst of Conrad&rsquo;s delightful
chapter, &ldquo;The Weight of the Burden,&rdquo; I heard Mr. Pike
come along the hall.</p>
<p>Stealing a glance over the top of my book, I saw him go by,
sea-booted, oilskinned, sou&rsquo;westered.&nbsp; It was his
watch below, and his sleep was meagre in this perpetual bad
weather, yet he was going on deck.</p>
<p>I read and waited for an hour, but he did not return; and I
knew that somewhere up above he was staring into the driving
dark.&nbsp; I dressed fully, in all my heavy storm-gear, from
sea-boots and sou&rsquo;-wester to sheepskin under my oilskin
coat.&nbsp; At the foot of the stairs I noted along the hall that
Margaret&rsquo;s light was burning.&nbsp; I peeped in&mdash;she
keeps her door open for ventilation&mdash;and found her
reading.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Merely not sleepy,&rdquo; she assured me.</p>
<p>Nor in the heart of me do I believe she had any
apprehension.&nbsp; She does not know even now, I am confident,
the Samurai&rsquo;s blunder&mdash;if blunder it was.&nbsp; As she
said, she was merely not sleepy, although there is no telling in
what occult ways she may have received though not recognized Mr.
Pike&rsquo;s anxiety.</p>
<p>At the head of the stairs, passing along the tiny hall to go
out the lee door of the chart-house, I glanced into the
chart-room.&nbsp; On the couch, lying on his back, his head
uncomfortably high, I thought, slept Captain West.&nbsp; The room
was warm from the ascending heat of the cabin, so that he lay
unblanketed, fully dressed save for oilskins and boots.&nbsp; He
breathed easily and steadily, and the lean, ascetic lines of his
face seemed softened by the light of the low-turned lamp.&nbsp;
And that one glance restored to me all my surety and faith in his
wisdom, so that I laughed at myself for having left my warm bed
for a freezing trip on deck.</p>
<p>Under the weather cloth at the break of the poop I found Mr.
Mellaire.&nbsp; He was wide awake, but under no strain.&nbsp;
Evidently it had not entered his mind to consider, much less
question, the manoeuvre of wearing ship the previous
afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gale is breaking,&rdquo; he told me, waving his
mittened hand at a starry segment of sky momentarily exposed by
the thinning clouds.</p>
<p>But where was Mr. Pike?&nbsp; Did the second mate know he was
on deck?&nbsp; I proceeded to feel Mr. Mellaire out as we worked
our way aft, along the mad poop toward the wheel.&nbsp; I talked
about the difficulty of sleeping in stormy weather, stated the
restlessness and semi-insomnia that the violent motion of the
ship caused in me, and raised the query of how bad weather
affected the officers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I noticed Captain West, in the chart-room, as I came
up, sleeping like a baby,&rdquo; I concluded.</p>
<p>We leaned in the lee of the chart-house and went no
farther.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trust us to sleep just the same way, Mr.
Pathurst,&rdquo; the second mate laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;The harder
the weather the harder the demand on us, and the harder we
sleep.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m dead the moment my head touches the
pillow.&nbsp; It takes Mr. Pike longer, because he always
finishes his cigarette after he turns in.&nbsp; But he smokes
while he&rsquo;s undressing, so that he doesn&rsquo;t require
more than a minute to go deado.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll wager he
hasn&rsquo;t moved, right now, since ten minutes after
twelve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the second mate did not dream the first was even on
deck.&nbsp; I went below to make sure.&nbsp; A small sea-lamp was
burning in Mr. Pike&rsquo;s room, and I saw his bunk
unoccupied.&nbsp; I went in by the big stove in the dining-room
and warmed up, then again came on deck.&nbsp; I did not go near
the weather cloth, where I was certain Mr. Mellaire was; but,
keeping along the lee of the poop, I gained the bridge and
started for&rsquo;ard.</p>
<p>I was in no hurry, so I paused often in that cold, wet
journey.&nbsp; The gale was breaking, for again and again the
stars glimmered through the thinning storm-clouds.&nbsp; On the
&rsquo;midship-house was no Mr. Pike.&nbsp; I crossed it, stung
by the freezing, flying spray, and carefully reconnoitred the top
of the for&rsquo;ard-house, where, in such bad weather, I knew
the lookout was stationed.&nbsp; I was within twenty feet of
them, when a wider clearance of starry sky showed me the figures
of the lookout, whoever he was, and of Mr. Pike, side by
side.&nbsp; Long I watched them, not making my presence known,
and I knew that the old mate&rsquo;s eyes were boring like
gimlets into the windy darkness that separated the
<i>Elsinore</i> from the thunder-surfed iron coast he sought to
find.</p>
<p>Coming back to the poop I was caught by the surprised Mr.
Mellaire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought you were asleep, sir,&rdquo; he chided.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m too restless,&rdquo; I explained.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve read until my eyes are tired, and now I&rsquo;m
trying to get chilled so that I can fall asleep while warming up
in my blankets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I envy you, sir,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Think
of it!&nbsp; So much of all night in that you cannot sleep.&nbsp;
Some day, if ever I make a lucky strike, I shall make a voyage
like this as a passenger, and have all watches below.&nbsp; Think
of it!&nbsp; All blessed watches below!&nbsp; And I shall, like
you, sir, bring a Jap servant along, and I&rsquo;ll make him call
me at every changing of the watches, so that, wide awake, I can
appreciate my good fortune in the several minutes before I roll
over and go to sleep again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We laughed good night to each other.&nbsp; Another peep into
the chart-room showed me Captain West sleeping as before.&nbsp;
He had not moved in general, though all his body moved with every
roll and fling of the ship.&nbsp; Below, Margaret&rsquo;s light
still burned, but a peep showed her asleep, her book fallen from
her hands just as was the so frequent case with my books.</p>
<p>And I wondered.&nbsp; Half the souls of us on the
<i>Elsinore</i> slept.&nbsp; The Samurai slept.&nbsp; Yet the old
first mate, who should have slept, kept a bitter watch on the
for&rsquo;ard-house.&nbsp; Was his anxiety right?&nbsp; Could it
be right?&nbsp; Or was it the crankiness of ultimate age?&nbsp;
Were we drifting and leewaying to destruction?&nbsp; Or was it
merely an old man being struck down by senility in the midst of
his life-task?</p>
<p>Too wide awake to think of sleeping, I ensconced myself with
<i>The Mirror of the Sea</i> at the dining-table.&nbsp; Nor did I
remove aught of my storm-gear save the soggy mittens, which I
wrung out and hung to dry by the stove.&nbsp; Four bells struck,
and six bells, and Mr. Pike had not returned below.&nbsp; At
eight bells, with the changing of the watches, it came upon me
what a night of hardship the old mate was enduring.&nbsp; Eight
to twelve had been his own watch on deck.&nbsp; He had now
completed the four hours of the second mate&rsquo;s watch and was
beginning his own watch, which would last till eight in the
morning&mdash;twelve consecutive hours in a Cape Horn gale with
the mercury at freezing.</p>
<p>Next&mdash;for I had dozed&mdash;I heard loud cries above my
head that were repeated along the poop.&nbsp; I did not know till
afterwards that it was Mr. Pike&rsquo;s command to hard-up the
helm, passed along from for&rsquo;ard by the men he had stationed
at intervals on the bridge.</p>
<p>All that I knew at this shock of waking was that something was
happening above.&nbsp; As I pulled on my steaming mittens and
hurried my best up the reeling stairs, I could hear the stamp of
men&rsquo;s feet that for once were not lagging.&nbsp; In the
chart-house hall I heard Mr. Pike, who had already covered the
length of the bridge from the for&rsquo;ard-house, shouting:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mizzen-braces!&nbsp; Slack, damn you!&nbsp; Slack on
the run!&nbsp; But hold a turn!&nbsp; Aft, here, all of
you!&nbsp; Jump!&nbsp; Lively, if you don&rsquo;t want to
swim!&nbsp; Come in, port-braces!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t let &rsquo;m
get away!&nbsp; Lee-braces!&mdash;if you lose that turn
I&rsquo;ll split your skull!&nbsp; Lively!&nbsp; Lively!&mdash;Is
that helm hard over!&nbsp; Why in hell don&rsquo;t you
answer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this I heard as I dashed for the lee door and as I
wondered why I did not hear the Samurai&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>Then, as I passed the chart-room door, I saw him.</p>
<p>He was sitting on the couch, white-faced, one sea-boot in his
hands, and I could have sworn his hands were shaking.&nbsp; That
much I saw, and the next moment was out on deck.</p>
<p>At first, just emerged from the light, I could see nothing,
although I could hear men at the pin-rails and the mate snarling
and shouting commands.&nbsp; But I knew the manoeuvre.&nbsp; With
a weak crew, in the big, tail-end sea of a broken gale, breakers
and destruction under her lee, the <i>Elsinore</i> was being worn
around.&nbsp; We had been under lower-topsails and a reefed
foresail all night.&nbsp; Mr. Pike&rsquo;s first action, after
putting the wheel up, had been to square the mizzen-yards.&nbsp;
With the wind-pressure thus eased aft, the stern could more
easily swing against the wind while the wind-pressure on the
for&rsquo;ard-sails paid the bow off.</p>
<p>But it takes time to wear a ship, under short canvas, in a big
sea.&nbsp; Slowly, very slowly, I could feel the direction of the
wind altering against my cheek.&nbsp; The moon, dim at first,
showed brighter and brighter as the last shreds of a flying cloud
drove away from before it.&nbsp; In vain I looked for any
land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Main-braces!&mdash;all of you!&mdash;jump!&rdquo; Mr.
Pike shouted, himself leading the rush along the poop.&nbsp; And
the men really rushed.&nbsp; Not in all the months I had observed
them had I seen such swiftness of energy.</p>
<p>I made my way to the wheel, where Tom Spink stood.&nbsp; He
did not notice me.&nbsp; With one hand holding the idle wheel, he
was leaning out to one side, his eyes fixed in a fascinated
stare.&nbsp; I followed its direction, on between the chart-house
and the port-jigger shrouds, and on across a mountain sea that
was very vague in the moonlight.&nbsp; And then I saw it!&nbsp;
The <i>Elsinore&rsquo;s</i> stern was flung skyward, and across
that cold ocean I saw land&mdash;black rocks and snow-covered
slopes and crags.&nbsp; And toward this land the <i>Elsinore</i>,
now almost before the wind, was driving.</p>
<p>From the &rsquo;midship-house came the snarls of the mate and
the cries of the sailors.&nbsp; They were pulling and hauling for
very life.&nbsp; Then came Mr. Pike, across the poop, leaping
with incredible swiftness, sending his snarl before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ease that wheel there!&nbsp; What the hell you
gawkin&rsquo; at?&nbsp; Steady her as I tell you.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s all you got to do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>From for&rsquo;ard came a cry, and I knew Mr. Mellaire was on
top of the for&rsquo;ard-house and managing the fore-yards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo;&mdash;from Mr. Pike.&nbsp; &ldquo;More
spokes!&nbsp; Steady!&nbsp; Steady!&nbsp; And be ready to check
her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bounded away along the poop again, shouting for men for the
mizzen-braces.&nbsp; And the men appeared, some of his watch,
others of the second mate&rsquo;s watch, routed from
sleep&mdash;men coatless, and hatless, and bootless; men
ghastly-faced with fear but eager for once to spring to the
orders of the man who knew and could save their miserable lives
from miserable death.&nbsp; Yes&mdash;and I noted the
delicate-handed cook, and Yatsuda, the sail-maker, pulling with
his one unparalysed hand.&nbsp; It was all hands to save ship,
and all hands knew it.&nbsp; Even Sundry Buyers, who had drifted
aft in his stupidity instead of being for&rsquo;ard with his own
officer, forebore to stare about and to press his abdomen.&nbsp;
For the nonce he pulled like a youngling of twenty.</p>
<p>The moon covered again, and it was in darkness that the
<i>Elsinore</i> rounded up on the wind on the starboard
tack.&nbsp; This, in her case, under lower-topsails only, meant
that she lay eight points from the wind, or, in land terms, at
right angles to the wind.</p>
<p>Mr. Pike was splendid, marvellous.&nbsp; Even as the
<i>Elsinore</i> was rounding to on the wind, while the head-yards
were still being braced, and even as he was watching the
ship&rsquo;s behaviour and the wheel, in between his commands to
Tom Spink of &ldquo;A spoke!&nbsp; A spoke or two!&nbsp;
Another!&nbsp; Steady!&nbsp; Hold her!&nbsp; Ease her!&rdquo; he
was ordering the men aloft to loose sail.&nbsp; I had thought,
the manoeuvre of wearing achieved, that we were saved, but this
setting of all three upper-topsails unconvinced me.</p>
<p>The moon remained hidden, and to leeward nothing could be
seen.&nbsp; As each sail was set, the <i>Elsinore</i> was pressed
farther and farther over, and I realized that there was plenty of
wind left, despite the fact that the gale had broken or was
breaking.&nbsp; Also, under this additional canvas, I could feel
the <i>Elsinore</i> moving through the water.&nbsp; Pike now sent
the Maltese Cockney to help Tom Spink at the wheel.&nbsp; As for
himself, he took his stand beside the booby-hatch, where he could
gauge the <i>Elsinore</i>, gaze to leeward, and keep his eye on
the helmsmen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Full and by,&rdquo; was his reiterated command.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Keep her a good full&mdash;a rap-full; but don&rsquo;t let
her fall away.&nbsp; Hold her to it, and drive her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took no notice whatever of me, although I, on my way to the
lee of the chart-house, stood at his shoulder a full minute,
offering him a chance to speak.&nbsp; He knew I was there, for
his big shoulder brushed my arm as he swayed and turned to warn
the helmsmen in the one breath to hold her up to it but to keep
her full.&nbsp; He had neither time nor courtesy for a passenger
in such a moment.</p>
<p>Sheltering by the chart-house, I saw the moon appear.&nbsp; It
grew brighter and brighter, and I saw the land, dead to leeward
of us, not three hundred yards away.&nbsp; It was a cruel
sight&mdash;black rock and bitter snow, with cliffs so
perpendicular that the <i>Elsinore</i> could have laid alongside
of them in deep water, with great gashes and fissures, and with
great surges thundering and spouting along all the length of
it.</p>
<p>Our predicament was now clear to me.&nbsp; We had to weather
the bight of land and islands into which we had drifted, and sea
and wind worked directly on shore.&nbsp; The only way out was to
drive through the water, to drive fast and hard, and this was
borne in upon me by Mr. Pike bounding past to the break of the
poop, where I heard him shout to Mr. Mellaire to set the
mainsail.</p>
<p>Evidently the second mate was dubious, for the next cry of Mr.
Pike&rsquo;s was:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn the reef!&nbsp; You&rsquo;d be in hell
first!&nbsp; Full mainsail!&nbsp; All hands to it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The difference was appreciable at once when that huge spread
of canvas opposed the wind.&nbsp; The <i>Elsinore</i> fairly
leaped and quivered as she sprang to it, and I could feel her eat
to windward as she at the same time drove faster ahead.&nbsp;
Also, in the rolls and gusts, she was forced down till her
lee-rail buried and the sea foamed level across to her
hatches.&nbsp; Mr. Pike watched her like a hawk, and like certain
death he watched the Maltese Cockney and Tom Spink at the
wheel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Land on the lee bow!&rdquo; came a cry from
for&rsquo;ard, that was carried on from mouth to mouth along the
bridge to the poop.</p>
<p>I saw Mr. Pike nod his head grimly and sarcastically.&nbsp; He
had already seen it from the lee-poop, and what he had not seen
he had guessed.&nbsp; A score of times I saw him test the weight
of the gusts on his cheek and with all the brain of him study the
<i>Elsinore&rsquo;s</i> behaviour.&nbsp; And I knew what was in
his mind.&nbsp; Could she carry what she had?&nbsp; Could she
carry more?</p>
<p>Small wonder, in this tense passage of time, that I had
forgotten the Samurai.&nbsp; Nor did I remember him until the
chart-house door swung open and I caught him by the arm.&nbsp; He
steadied and swayed beside me, while he watched that cruel
picture of rock and snow and spouting surf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good full!&rdquo; Mr. Pike snarled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Or
I&rsquo;ll eat your heart out.&nbsp; God damn you for the
farmer&rsquo;s hound you are, Tom Spink!&nbsp; Ease her!&nbsp;
Ease her!&nbsp; Ease her into the big ones, damn you!&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t let her head fall off!&nbsp; Steady!&nbsp; Where in
hell did you learn to steer?&nbsp; What cow-farm was you raised
on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here he bounded for&rsquo;ard past us with those incredible
leaps of his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be good to set the mizzen-topgallant,&rdquo; I
heard Captain West mutter in a weak, quavery voice.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mr. Pathurst, will you please tell Mr. Pike to set the
mizzen-topgallant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And at that very instant Mr. Pike&rsquo;s voice rang out from
the break of the poop:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Mellaire!&mdash;the mizzen-topgallant!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain West&rsquo;s head drooped until his chin rested on his
breast, and so low did he mutter that I leaned to hear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very good officer,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;An
excellent officer.&nbsp; Mr. Pathurst, if you will kindly favour
me, I should like to go in.&nbsp; I . . . I haven&rsquo;t got on
my boots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The muscular feat was to open the heavy iron door and hold it
open in the rolls and plunges.&nbsp; This I accomplished; but
when I had helped Captain West across the high threshold he
thanked me and waived further services.&nbsp; And I did not know
even then he was dying.</p>
<p>Never was a Blackwood ship driven as was the <i>Elsinore</i>
during the next half-hour.&nbsp; The full-jib was also set, and,
as it departed in shreds, the fore-topmast staysail was being
hoisted.&nbsp; For&rsquo;ard of the &rsquo;midship-house it was
made unlivable by the bursting seas.&nbsp; Mr. Mellaire, with
half the crew, clung on somehow on top the &rsquo;midship-house,
while the rest of the crew was with us in the comparative safety
of the poop.&nbsp; Even Charles Davis, drenched and shivering,
hung on beside me to the brass ring-handle of the chart-house
door.</p>
<p>Such sailing!&nbsp; It was a madness of speed and motion, for
the <i>Elsinore</i> drove over and through and under those huge
graybeards that thundered shore-ward.&nbsp; There were times,
when rolls and gusts worked against her at the same moment, when
I could have sworn the ends of her lower-yardarms swept the
sea.</p>
<p>It was one chance in ten that we could claw off.&nbsp; All
knew it, and all knew there was nothing more to do but await the
issue.&nbsp; And we waited in silence.&nbsp; The only voice was
that of the mate, intermittently cursing, threatening, and
ordering Tom Spink and the Maltese Cockney at the wheel.&nbsp;
Between whiles, and all the while, he gauged the gusts, and ever
his eyes lifted to the main-topgallant-yard.&nbsp; He wanted to
set that one more sail.&nbsp; A dozen times I saw him half-open
his mouth to give the order he dared not give.&nbsp; And as I
watched him, so all watched him.&nbsp; Hard-bitten,
bitter-natured, sour-featured and snarling-mouthed, he was the
one man, the henchman of the race, the master of the
moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;And where,&rdquo; was my thought, &ldquo;O
where was the Samurai?&rdquo;</p>
<p>One chance in ten?&nbsp; It was one in a hundred as we fought
to weather the last bold tooth of rock that gashed into sea and
tempest between us and open ocean.&nbsp; So close were we that I
looked to see our far-reeling skysail-yards strike the face of
the rock.&nbsp; So close were we, no more than a biscuit toss
from its iron buttress, that as we sank down into the last great
trough between two seas I can swear every one of us held breath
and waited for the <i>Elsinore</i> to strike.</p>
<p>Instead we drove free.&nbsp; And as if in very rage at our
escape, the storm took that moment to deal us the mightiest
buffet of all.&nbsp; The mate felt that monster sea coming, for
he sprang to the wheel ere the blow fell.&nbsp; I looked
for&rsquo;ard, and I saw all for&rsquo;ard blotted out by the
mountain of water that fell aboard.&nbsp; The <i>Elsinore</i>
righted from the shock and reappeared to the eye, full of water
from rail to rail.&nbsp; Then a gust caught her sails and heeled
her over, spilling half the enormous burden outboard again.</p>
<p>Along the bridge came the relayed cry of &ldquo;Man
overboard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I glanced at the mate, who had just released the wheel to the
helmsmen.&nbsp; He shook his head, as if irritated by so trivial
a happening, walked to the corner of the half-wheelhouse, and
stared at the coast he had escaped, white and black and cold in
the moonlight.</p>
<p>Mr. Mellaire came aft, and they met beside me in the lee of
the chart-house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All hands, Mr. Mellaire,&rdquo; the mate said,
&ldquo;and get the mainsail off of her.&nbsp; After that, the
mizzen-topgallant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said the second.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was it?&rdquo; the mate asked, as Mr. Mellaire was
turning away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boney&mdash;he was no good, anyway,&rdquo; came the
answer.</p>
<p>That was all.&nbsp; Boney the Splinter was gone, and all hands
were answering the command of Mr. Mellaire to take in the
mainsail.&nbsp; But they never took it in; for at that moment it
started to blow away out of the bolt-ropes, and in but few
moments all that was left of it was a few short, slatting
ribbons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mizzen-topgallant-sail!&rdquo; Mr. Pike ordered.&nbsp;
Then, and for the first time, he recognized my existence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well rid of it,&rdquo; he growled.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
never did set properly.&nbsp; I was always aching to get my hands
on the sail-maker that made it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On my way below a glance into the chart-room gave me the cue
to the Samurai&rsquo;s blunder&mdash;if blunder it can be called,
for no one will ever know.&nbsp; He lay on the floor in a loose
heap, rolling willy-nilly with every roll of the
<i>Elsinore</i>.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIX</h2>
<p>There is so much to write about all at once.&nbsp; In the
first place, Captain West.&nbsp; Not entirely unexpected was his
death.&nbsp; Margaret tells me that she was apprehensive from the
start of the voyage&mdash;and even before.&nbsp; It was because
of her apprehension that she so abruptly changed her plans and
accompanied her father.</p>
<p>What really happened we do not know, but the agreed surmise is
that it was some stroke of the heart.&nbsp; And yet, after the
stroke, did he not come out on deck?&nbsp; Or could the first
stroke have been followed by another and fatal one after I had
helped him inside through the door?&nbsp; And even so, I have
never heard of a heart-stroke being preceded hours before by a
weakening of the mind.&nbsp; Captain West&rsquo;s mind seemed
quite clear, and must have been quite clear, that last afternoon
when he wore the <i>Elsinore</i> and started the lee-shore
drift.&nbsp; In which case it was a blunder.&nbsp; The Samurai
blundered, and his heart destroyed him when he became aware of
the blunder.</p>
<p>At any rate the thought of blunder never enters
Margaret&rsquo;s head.&nbsp; She accepts, as a matter of course,
that it was all a part of the oncoming termination of his
sickness.&nbsp; And no one will ever undeceive her.&nbsp; Neither
Mr. Pike, Mr. Mellaire, nor I, among ourselves, mention a whisper
of what so narrowly missed causing disaster.&nbsp; In fact, Mr.
Pike does not talk about the matter at all.&mdash;And then,
again, might it not have been something different from heart
disease?&nbsp; Or heart disease complicated with something else
that obscured his mind that afternoon before his death?&nbsp;
Well, no one knows, and I, for one, shall not sit, even in secret
judgment, on the event.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>At midday of the day we clawed off Tierra Del Fuego the
<i>Elsinore</i> was rolling in a dead calm, and all afternoon she
rolled, not a score of miles off the land.&nbsp; Captain West was
buried at four o&rsquo;clock, and at eight bells that evening Mr.
Pike assumed command and made a few remarks to both
watches.&nbsp; They were straight-from-the-shoulder remarks, or,
as he called them, they were &ldquo;brass tacks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among other things he told the sailors that they had another
boss, and that they would toe the mark as they never had
before.&nbsp; Up to this time they had been loafing in an hotel,
but from this time on they were going to work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On this hooker, from now on,&rdquo; he perorated,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s going to be like old times, when a man jumped
the last day of the voyage as well as the first.&nbsp; And God
help the man that don&rsquo;t jump.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s all.&nbsp;
Relieve the wheel and lookout.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>And yet the men are in terribly wretched condition.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t see how they can jump.&nbsp; Another week of westerly
gales, alternating with brief periods of calm, has elapsed,
making a total of six weeks off the Horn.&nbsp; So weak are the
men that they have no spirit left in them&mdash;not even the
gangsters.&nbsp; And so afraid are they of the mate that they
really do their best to jump when he drives them, and he drives
them all the time.&nbsp; Mr. Mellaire shakes his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait till they get around and up into better
weather,&rdquo; he astonished me by telling me the other
afternoon.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wait till they get dried out, and rested
up, with more sleep, and their sores healed, and more flesh on
their bones, and more spunk in their blood&mdash;then they
won&rsquo;t stand for this driving.&nbsp; Mr. Pike can&rsquo;t
realize that times have changed, sir, and laws have changed, and
men have changed.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s an old man, and I know what I
am talking about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you&rsquo;ve been listening to the talk of the
men?&rdquo; I challenged rashly, all my gorge rising at the
unofficerlike conduct of this ship&rsquo;s officer.</p>
<p>The shot went home, for, in a flash, that suave and gentle
film of light vanished from the surface of the eyes, and the
watching, fearful thing that lurked behind inside the skull
seemed almost to leap out at me, while the cruel gash of mouth
drew thinner and crueller.&nbsp; And at the same time, on my
inner sight, was grotesquely limned a picture of a brain pulsing
savagely against the veneer of skin that covered that cleft of
skull beneath the dripping sou&rsquo;-wester.&nbsp; Then he
controlled himself, the mouth-gash relaxed, and the suave and
gentle film drew again across the eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean, sir,&rdquo; he said softly, &ldquo;that I am
speaking out of a long sea experience.&nbsp; Times have
changed.&nbsp; The old driving days are gone.&nbsp; And I trust,
Mr. Pathurst, that you will not misunderstand me in the matter,
nor misinterpret what I have said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although the conversation drifted on to other and calmer
topics, I could not ignore the fact that he had not denied
listening to the talk of the men.&nbsp; And yet, even as Mr. Pike
grudgingly admits, he is a good sailorman and second mate save
for his unholy intimacy with the men for&rsquo;ard&mdash;an
intimacy which even the Chinese cook and the Chinese steward
deplore as unseamanlike and perilous.</p>
<p>Even though men like the gangsters are so worn down by
hardship that they have no heart of rebellion, there remain three
of the frailest for&rsquo;ard who will not die, and who are as
spunky as ever.&nbsp; They are Andy Fay, Mulligan Jacobs, and
Charles Davis.&nbsp; What strange, abysmal vitality informs them
is beyond all speculation.&nbsp; Of course, Charles Davis should
have been overside with a sack of coal at his feet long
ago.&nbsp; And Andy Fay and Mulligan Jacobs are only, and have
always been, wrecked and emaciated wisps of men.&nbsp; Yet far
stronger men than they have gone over the side, and far stronger
men than they are laid up right now in absolute physical
helplessness in the soggy forecastle bunks.&nbsp; And these two
bitter flames of shreds of things stand all their watches and
answer all calls for both watches.</p>
<p>Yes; and the chickens have something of this same spunk of
life in them.&nbsp; Featherless, semi-frozen despite the
oil-stove, sprayed dripping on occasion by the frigid seas that
pound by sheer weight through canvas tarpaulins, nevertheless not
a chicken has died.&nbsp; Is it a matter of selection?&nbsp; Are
these the iron-vigoured ones that survived the hardships from
Baltimore to the Horn, and are fitted to survive anything?&nbsp;
Then for a De Vries to take them, save them, and out of them
found the hardiest breed of chickens on the planet!&nbsp; And
after this I shall always query that phrase, most ancient in our
language&mdash;&ldquo;chicken-hearted.&rdquo;&nbsp; Measured by
the <i>Elsinore&rsquo;s</i> chickens, it is a misnomer.</p>
<p>Nor are our three Horn Gypsies, the storm-visitors with the
dreaming, topaz eyes, spunkless.&nbsp; Held in superstitious
abhorrence by the rest of the crew, aliens by lack of any word of
common speech, nevertheless they are good sailors and are always
first to spring into any enterprise of work or peril.&nbsp; They
have gone into Mr. Mellaire&rsquo;s watch, and they are quite
apart from the rest of the sailors.&nbsp; And when there is a
delay, or wait, with nothing to do for long minutes, they
shoulder together, and stand and sway to the heave of deck, and
dream far dreams in those pale, topaz eyes, of a country, I am
sure, where mothers, with pale, topaz eyes and sandy hair, birth
sons and daughters that breed true in terms of topaz eyes and
sandy hair.</p>
<p>But the rest of the crew!&nbsp; Take the Maltese
Cockney.&nbsp; He is too keenly intelligent, too sharply
sensitive, successfully to endure.&nbsp; He is a shadow of his
former self.&nbsp; His cheeks have fallen in.&nbsp; Dark circles
of suffering are under his eyes, while his eyes, Latin and
English intermingled, are cavernously sunken and as
bright-burning as if aflame with fever.</p>
<p>Tom Spink, hard-fibred Anglo-Saxon, good seaman that he is,
long tried and always proved, is quite wrecked in spirit.&nbsp;
He is whining and fearful.&nbsp; So broken is he, though he still
does his work, that he is prideless and shameless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never ship around the Horn again,
sir,&rdquo; he began on me the other day when I greeted him good
morning at the wheel.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve sworn it before,
but this time I mean it.&nbsp; Never again, sir.&nbsp; Never
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you swear it before?&rdquo; I queried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was on the <i>Nahoma</i>, sir, four years ago.&nbsp;
Two hundred and thirty days from Liverpool to
&rsquo;Frisco.&nbsp; Think of it, sir.&nbsp; Two hundred and
thirty days!&nbsp; And we was loaded with cement and creosote,
and the creosote got loose.&nbsp; We buried the captain right
here off the Horn.&nbsp; The grub gave out.&nbsp; Most of us
nearly died of scurvy.&nbsp; Every man Jack of us was carted to
hospital in &rsquo;Frisco.&nbsp; It was plain hell, sir,
that&rsquo;s what it was, an&rsquo; two hundred and thirty days
of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet here you are,&rdquo; I laughed; &ldquo;signed on
another Horn voyage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And this morning Tom Spink confided the following tome:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only we&rsquo;d lost the carpenter, sir, instead of
Boney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did not catch his drift for the moment; then I
remembered.&nbsp; The carpenter was the Finn, the Jonah, the
warlock who played tricks with the winds and despitefully used
poor sailormen.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Yes, and I make free to confess that I have grown well weary
of this eternal buffeting by the Great West Wind.&nbsp; Nor are
we alone in our travail on this desolate ocean.&nbsp; Never a day
does the gray thin, or the snow-squalls cease that we do not
sight ships, west-bound like ourselves, hove-to and trying to
hold on to the meagre westing they possess.&nbsp; And
occasionally, when the gray clears and lifts, we see a lucky
ship, bound east, running before it and reeling off the
miles.&nbsp; I saw Mr. Pike, yesterday, shaking his fist in a
fury of hatred at one such craft that flew insolently past us not
a quarter of a mile away.</p>
<p>And the men are jumping.&nbsp; Mr. Pike is driving with those
block-square fists of his, as many a man&rsquo;s face
attests.&nbsp; So weak are they, and so terrible is he, that I
swear he could whip either watch single-handed.&nbsp; I cannot
help but note that Mr. Mellaire refuses to take part in this
driving.&nbsp; Yet I know that he is a trained driver, and that
he was not averse to driving at the outset of the voyage.&nbsp;
But now he seems bent on keeping on good terms with the
crew.&nbsp; I should like to know what Mr. Pike thinks of it, for
he cannot possibly be blind to what is going on; but I am too
well aware of what would happen if I raised the question.&nbsp;
He would insult me, snap my head off, and indulge in a
three-days&rsquo; sea-grouch.&nbsp; Things are sad and monotonous
enough for Margaret and me in the cabin and at table, without
invoking the blight of the mate&rsquo;s displeasure.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XL</h2>
<p>Another brutal sea-superstition vindicated.&nbsp; From now on
and for always these imbeciles of ours will believe that Finns
are Jonahs.&nbsp; We are west of the Diego de Ramirez Rocks, and
we are running west at a twelve-knot clip with an easterly gale
at our backs.&nbsp; And the carpenter is gone.&nbsp; His passing,
and the coming of the easterly wind, were coincidental.</p>
<p>It was yesterday morning, as he helped me to dress, that I was
struck by the solemnity of Wada&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; He shook his
head lugubriously as he broke the news.&nbsp; The carpenter was
missing.&nbsp; The ship had been searched for him high and
low.&nbsp; There just was no carpenter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does the steward think?&rdquo; I asked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What does Louis think?&mdash;and Yatsuda?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sailors, they kill &rsquo;m carpenter sure,&rdquo;
was the answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Very bad ship this.&nbsp; Very bad
hearts.&nbsp; Just the same pig, just the same dog.&nbsp; All the
time kill.&nbsp; All the time kill.&nbsp; Bime-by everybody
kill.&nbsp; You see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old steward, at work in his pantry, grinned at me when I
mentioned the matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They make fool with me, I fix &rsquo;em,&rdquo; he said
vindictively.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mebbe they kill me, all right; but I
kill some, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He threw back his coat, and I saw, strapped to the left side
of his body, in a canvas sheath, so that the handle was ready to
hand, a meat knife of the heavy sort that butchers hack
with.&nbsp; He drew it forth&mdash;it was fully two feet
long&mdash;and, to demonstrate its razor-edge, sliced a sheet of
newspaper into many ribbons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; he laughed sardonically.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am
Chink, monkey, damn fool, eh?&mdash;no good, eh? all rotten damn
to hell.&nbsp; I fix &rsquo;em, they make fool with
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And yet there is not the slightest evidence of foul
play.&nbsp; Nobody knows what happened to the carpenter.&nbsp;
There are no clues, no traces.&nbsp; The night was calm and
snowy.&nbsp; No seas broke on board.&nbsp; Without doubt the
clumsy, big-footed, over-grown giant of a boy is overside and
dead.&nbsp; The question is: did he go over of his own accord, or
was he put over?</p>
<p>At eight o&rsquo;clock Mr. Pike proceeded to interrogate the
watches.&nbsp; He stood at the break of the poop, in the high
place, leaning on the rail and gazing down at the crew assembled
on the main deck beneath him.</p>
<p>Man after man he questioned, and from each man came the one
story.&nbsp; They knew no more about it than did we&mdash;or so
they averred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ll be chargin&rsquo; next that I
hove that big lummux overboard with me own hands,&rdquo; Mulligan
Jacobs snarled, when he was questioned.&nbsp; &ldquo;An&rsquo;
mebbe I did, bein&rsquo; that husky an&rsquo; rampagin&rsquo;
bull-like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mate&rsquo;s face grew more forbidding and sour, but
without comment he passed on to John Hackey, the San Francisco
hoodlum.</p>
<p>It was an unforgettable scene&mdash;the mate in the high
place, the men, sullen and irresponsive, grouped beneath.&nbsp; A
gentle snow drifted straight down through the windless air, while
the <i>Elsinore</i>, with hollow thunder from her sails, rolled
down on the quiet swells so that the ocean lapped the mouths of
her scuppers with long-drawn, shuddering sucks and sobs.&nbsp;
And all the men swayed in unison to the rolls, their hands in
mittens, their feet in sack-wrapped sea-boots, their faces worn
and sick.&nbsp; And the three dreamers with the topaz eyes stood
and swayed and dreamed together, incurious of setting and
situation.</p>
<p>And then it came&mdash;the hint of easterly air.&nbsp; The
mate noted it first.&nbsp; I saw him start and turn his cheek to
the almost imperceptible draught.&nbsp; Then I felt it.&nbsp; A
minute longer he waited, until assured, when, the dead carpenter
forgotten, he burst out with orders to the wheel and the
crew.&nbsp; And the men jumped, though in their weakness the
climb aloft was slow and toilsome; and when the gaskets were off
the topgallant-sails and the men on deck were hoisting yards and
sheeting home, those aloft were loosing the royals.</p>
<p>While this work went on, and while the yards were being braced
around, the <i>Elsinore</i>, her bow pointing to the west, began
moving through the water before the first fair wind in a month
and a half.</p>
<p>Slowly that light air fanned to a gentle breeze while all the
time the snow fell steadily.&nbsp; The barometer, down to 28.80,
continued to fall, and the breeze continued to grow upon
itself.&nbsp; Tom Spink, passing by me on the poop to lend a hand
at the final finicky trimming of the mizzen-yards, gave me a
triumphant look.&nbsp; Superstition was vindicated.&nbsp; Events
had proved him right.&nbsp; Fair wind had come with the going of
the carpenter, which said warlock had incontestably taken with
him overside his bag of wind-tricks.</p>
<p>Mr. Pike strode up and down the poop, rubbing his hands, which
he was too disdainfully happy to mitten, chuckling and grinning
to himself, glancing at the draw of every sail, stealing adoring
looks astern into the gray of snow out of which blew the
favouring wind.&nbsp; He even paused beside me to gossip for a
moment about the French restaurants of San Francisco and how,
therein, the delectable California fashion of cooking wild duck
obtained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throw &rsquo;em through the fire,&rdquo; he
chanted.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way&mdash;throw &rsquo;em
through the fire&mdash;a hot oven, sixteen minutes&mdash;I take
mine fourteen, to the second&mdash;an&rsquo; squeeze the
carcasses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By midday the snow had ceased and we were bowling along before
a stiff breeze.&nbsp; At three in the afternoon we were running
before a growing gale.&nbsp; It was across a mad ocean we tore,
for the mounting sea that made from eastward bucked into the West
End Drift and battled and battered down the huge south-westerly
swell.&nbsp; And the big grinning dolt of a Finnish carpenter,
already food for fish and bird, was astern there somewhere in the
freezing rack and drive.</p>
<p>Make westing!&nbsp; We ripped it off across these narrowing
degrees of longitude at the southern tip of the planet where one
mile counts for two.&nbsp; And Mr. Pike, staring at his bending
topgallant-yards, swore that they could carry away for all he
cared ere he eased an inch of canvas.&nbsp; More he did.&nbsp; He
set the huge crojack, biggest of all sails, and challenged God or
Satan to start a seam of it or all its seams.</p>
<p>He simply could not go below.&nbsp; In such auspicious
occasions all watches were his, and he strode the poop
perpetually with all age-lag banished from his legs.&nbsp;
Margaret and I were with him in the chart-room when he hurrahed
the barometer, down to 28.55 and falling.&nbsp; And we were near
him, on the poop, when he drove by an east-bound lime-juicer,
hove-to under upper-topsails.&nbsp; We were a biscuit-toss away,
and he sprang upon the rail at the jigger-shrouds and danced a
war-dance and waved his free arm, and yelled his scorn and joy at
their discomfiture to the several oilskinned figures on the
stranger vessel&rsquo;s poop.</p>
<p>Through the pitch-black night we continued to drive.&nbsp; The
crew was sadly frightened, and I sought in vain, in the two
dog-watches, for Tom Spink, to ask him if he thought the
carpenter, astern, had opened wide the bag-mouth and loosed all
his tricks.&nbsp; For the first time I saw the steward
apprehensive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too much,&rdquo; he told me, with ominous rolling
head.&nbsp; &ldquo;Too much sail, rotten bad damn all to
hell.&nbsp; Bime-by, pretty quick, all finish.&nbsp; You
see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They talk about running the easting down,&rdquo; Mr.
Pike chortled to me, as we clung to the poop-rail to keep from
fetching away and breaking ribs and necks.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,
this is running your westing down if anybody should ride up in a
go-devil and ask you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a wretched, glorious night.&nbsp; Sleep was
impossible&mdash;for me, at any rate.&nbsp; Nor was there even
the comfort of warmth.&nbsp; Something had gone wrong with the
big cabin stove, due to our wild running, I fancy, and the
steward was compelled to let the fire go out.&nbsp; So we are
getting a taste of the hardship of the forecastle, though in our
case everything is dry instead of soggy or afloat.&nbsp; The
kerosene stoves burned in our state room, but so smelly was mine
that I preferred the cold.</p>
<p>To sail on one&rsquo;s nerve in an over-canvassed harbour
cat-boat is all the excitement any glutton can desire.&nbsp; But
to sail, in the same fashion, in a big ship off the Horn, is
incredible and terrible.&nbsp; The Great West Wind Drift, setting
squarely into the teeth of the easterly gale, kicked up a tideway
sea that was monstrous.&nbsp; Two men toiled at the wheel,
relieving in pairs every half-hour, and in the face of the cold
they streamed with sweat long ere their half-hour shift was
up.</p>
<p>Mr. Pike is of the elder race of men.&nbsp; His endurance is
prodigious.&nbsp; Watch and watch, and all watches, he held the
poop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never dreamed of it,&rdquo; he told me, at midnight,
as the great gusts tore by and as we listened for our lighter
spars to smash aloft and crash upon the deck.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
thought my last whirling sailing was past.&nbsp; And here we
are!&nbsp; Here we are!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord!&nbsp; Lord!&nbsp; I sailed third mate in the
little <i>Vampire</i> before you were born.&nbsp; Fifty-six men
before the mast, and the last Jack of &rsquo;em an able
seaman.&nbsp; And there were eight boys, an&rsquo; bosuns that
was bosuns, an&rsquo; sail-makers an&rsquo; carpenters an&rsquo;
stewards an&rsquo; passengers to jam the decks.&nbsp; An&rsquo;
three driving mates of us, an&rsquo; Captain Brown, the Little
Wonder.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t weigh a hundredweight, an&rsquo; he
drove us&mdash;he drove <i>us</i>, three drivin&rsquo; mates that
learned from him what drivin&rsquo; was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was knock down and drag out from the start.&nbsp;
The first hour of puttin&rsquo; the men to fair perished our
knuckles.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got the smashed joints yet to
show.&nbsp; Every sea-chest broke open, every sea-bag turned out,
and whiskey bottles, knuckle-dusters, sling-shots, bowie-knives,
an&rsquo; guns chucked overside by the armful.&nbsp; An&rsquo;
when we chose the watches, each man of fifty-six of &rsquo;em
laid his knife on the main-hatch an&rsquo; the carpenter broke
the point square off.&mdash;Yes, an&rsquo; the little
<i>Vampire</i> only eight hundred tons.&nbsp; The <i>Elsinore</i>
could carry her on her deck.&nbsp; But she was ship, all ship,
an&rsquo; them was men&rsquo;s days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Margaret, save for inability to sleep, did not mind the
driving, although Mr. Mellaire, on the other hand, admitted
apprehension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got my goat,&rdquo; he confided to me.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t right to drive a cargo-carrier this
way.&nbsp; This isn&rsquo;t a ballasted yacht.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a
coal-hulk.&nbsp; I know what driving was, but it was in ships
made to drive.&nbsp; Our iron-work aloft won&rsquo;t stand
it.&nbsp; Mr. Pathurst, I tell you frankly that it is criminal,
it is sheer murder, to run the <i>Elsinore</i> with that crojack
on her.&nbsp; You can see yourself, sir.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s an
after-sail.&nbsp; All its tendency is to throw her stern off and
her bow up to it.&nbsp; And if it ever happens, sir, if she ever
gets away from the wheel for two seconds and broaches to . . .
&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what?&rdquo; I asked, or, rather, shouted; for all
conversation had to be shouted close to ear in that blast of
gale.</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders, and all of him was eloquent with
the unuttered, unmistakable word&mdash;&ldquo;finish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At eight this morning Margaret and I struggled up to the
poop.&nbsp; And there was that indomitable, iron old man.&nbsp;
He had never left the deck all night.&nbsp; His eyes were bright,
and he appeared in the pink of well-being.&nbsp; He rubbed his
hands and chuckled greeting to us, and took up his
reminiscences.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In &rsquo;51, on this same stretch, Miss West, the
<i>Flying Cloud</i>, in twenty-four hours, logged three hundred
and seventy-four miles under her topgallant-sails.&nbsp; That was
sailing.&nbsp; She broke the record, that day, for sail an&rsquo;
steam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what are we averaging, Mr. Pike?&rdquo; Margaret
queried, while her eyes were fixed on the main deck, where
continually one rail and then the other dipped under the ocean
and filled across from rail to rail, only to spill out and take
in on the next roll.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thirteen for a fair average since five o&rsquo;clock
yesterday afternoon,&rdquo; he exulted.&nbsp; &ldquo;In the
squalls she makes all of sixteen, which is going some, for the
<i>Elsinore</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d take the crojack off if I had charge,&rdquo;
Margaret criticised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So would I, so would I, Miss West,&rdquo; he replied;
&ldquo;if we hadn&rsquo;t been six weeks already off the
Horn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She ran her eyes aloft, spar by spar, past the spars of hollow
steel to the wooden royals, which bent in the gusts like bows in
some invisible archer&rsquo;s hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re remarkably good sticks of timber,&rdquo;
was her comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well may you say it, Miss West,&rdquo; he agreed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d never a-believed they&rsquo;d a-stood it
myself.&nbsp; But just look at &rsquo;m!&nbsp; Just look at
&rsquo;m!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no breakfast for the men.&nbsp; Three times the
galley had been washed out, and the men, in the forecastle awash,
contented themselves with hard tack and cold salt horse.&nbsp;
Aft, with us, the steward scalded himself twice ere he succeeded
in making coffee over a kerosene-burner.</p>
<p>At noon we picked up a ship ahead, a lime-juicer, travelling
in the same direction, under lower-topsails and one
upper-topsail.&nbsp; The only one of her courses set was the
foresail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The way that skipper&rsquo;s carryin&rsquo; on is
shocking,&rdquo; Mr. Pike sneered.&nbsp; &ldquo;He should be more
cautious, and remember God, the owners, the underwriters, and the
Board of Trade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such was our speed that in almost no time we were up with the
stranger vessel and passing her.&nbsp; Mr. Pike was like a boy
just loosed from school.&nbsp; He altered our course so that we
passed her a hundred yards away.&nbsp; She was a gallant sight,
but, such was our speed, she appeared standing still.&nbsp; Mr.
Pike jumped upon the rail and insulted those on her poop by
extending a rope&rsquo;s end in invitation to take a tow.</p>
<p>Margaret shook her head privily to me as she gazed at our
bending royal-yards, but was caught in the act by Mr. Pike, who
cried out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kites she won&rsquo;t carry she can
drag!&rdquo;</p>
<p>An hour later I caught Tom Spink, just relieved from his shift
at the wheel and weak from exhaustion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think now of the carpenter and his bag of
tricks?&rdquo; I queried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord lumme, it should a-ben the mate, sir,&rdquo; was
his reply.</p>
<p>By five in the afternoon we had logged 314 miles since five
the previous day, which was two over an average of thirteen knots
for twenty-four consecutive hours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now take Captain Brown of the little
<i>Vampire</i>,&rdquo; Mr. Pike grinned to me, for our sailing
made him good-natured.&nbsp; &ldquo;He never would take in until
the kites an&rsquo; stu&rsquo;n&rsquo;sails was about his
ears.&nbsp; An&rsquo; when she was blown&rsquo; her worst
an&rsquo; we was half-fairly shortened down, he&rsquo;d turn in
for a snooze, an&rsquo; say to us, &lsquo;Call me if she
moderates.&rsquo;&nbsp; Yes, and I&rsquo;ll never forget the
night when I called him an&rsquo; told him that everything on top
the houses had gone adrift, an&rsquo; that two of the boats had
been swept aft and was kindling-wood against the break of the
cabin.&nbsp; &lsquo;Very well, Mr. Pike,&rsquo; he says,
battin&rsquo; his eyes and turnin&rsquo; over to go to sleep
again.&nbsp; &lsquo;Very well, Mr. Pike,&rsquo; says he.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Watch her.&nbsp; An&rsquo; Mr. Pike . . .&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; says I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Give me a call, Mr.
Pike, when the windlass shows signs of comin&rsquo;
aft.&rsquo;&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what he said, his very words,
an&rsquo; the next moment, damme, he was
snorin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>It is now midnight, and, cunningly wedged into my bunk, unable
to sleep, I am writing these lines with flying dabs of pencil at
my pad.&nbsp; And no more shall I write, I swear, until this gale
is blown out, or we are blown to Kingdom Come.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XLI</h2>
<p>The days have passed and I have broken my resolve; for here I
am again writing while the <i>Elsinore</i> surges along across a
magnificent, smoky, dusty sea.&nbsp; But I have two reasons for
breaking my word.&nbsp; First, and minor, we had a real dawn this
morning.&nbsp; The gray of the sea showed a streaky blue, and the
cloud-masses were actually pink-tipped by a really and truly
sun.</p>
<p>Second, and major, <i>we are around the Horn</i>!&nbsp; We are
north of 50 in the Pacific, in Longitude 80.49, with Cape Pillar
and the Straits of Magellan already south of east from us, and we
are heading north-north-west.&nbsp; <i>We are around the
Horn</i>!&nbsp; The profound significance of this can be
appreciated only by one who has wind-jammed around from east to
west.&nbsp; Blow high, blow low, nothing can happen to thwart
us.&nbsp; No ship north of 50 was ever blown back.&nbsp; From now
on it is plain sailing, and Seattle suddenly seems quite
near.</p>
<p>All the ship&rsquo;s company, with the exception of Margaret,
is better spirited.&nbsp; She is quiet, and a little down, though
she is anything but prone to the wastage of grief.&nbsp; In her
robust, vital philosophy God&rsquo;s always in heaven.&nbsp; I
may describe her as being merely subdued, and gentle, and
tender.&nbsp; And she is very wistful to receive gentle
consideration and tenderness from me.&nbsp; She is, after all,
the genuine woman.&nbsp; She wants the strength that man has to
give, and I flatter myself that I am ten times a stronger man
than I was when the voyage began, because I am a thousand times a
more human man since I told the books to go hang and began to
revel in the human maleness of the man that loves a woman and is
loved.</p>
<p>Returning to the ship&rsquo;s company.&nbsp; The rounding of
the Horn, the better weather that is continually growing better,
the easement of hardship and toil and danger, with the promise of
the tropics and of the balmy south-east trades before
them&mdash;all these factors contribute to pick up our men
again.&nbsp; The temperature has already so moderated that the
men are beginning to shed their surplusage of clothing, and they
no longer wrap sacking about their sea-boots.&nbsp; Last evening,
in the second dog-watch, I heard a man actually singing.</p>
<p>The steward has discarded the huge, hacking knife and relaxed
to the extent of engaging in an occasional sober romp with
Possum.&nbsp; Wada&rsquo;s face is no longer solemnly long, and
Louis&rsquo; Oxford accent is more mellifluous than ever.&nbsp;
Mulligan Jacobs and Andy Fay are the same venomous scorpions they
have always been.&nbsp; The three gangsters, with the clique they
lead, have again asserted their tyrrany and thrashed all the
weaklings and feeblings in the forecastle.&nbsp; Charles Davis
resolutely refuses to die, though how he survived that wet and
freezing room of iron through all the weeks off the Horn has
elicited wonder even from Mr. Pike, who has a most accurate
knowledge of what men can stand and what they cannot stand.</p>
<p>How Nietzsche, with his eternal slogan of &ldquo;Be
hard!&nbsp; Be hard!&rdquo; would have delighted in Mr. Pike!</p>
<p>And&mdash;oh!&mdash;Larry has had a tooth removed.&nbsp; For
some days distressed with a jumping toothache, he came aft to the
mate for relief.&nbsp; Mr. Pike refused to &ldquo;monkey&rdquo;
with the &ldquo;fangled&rdquo; forceps in the
medicine-chest.&nbsp; He used a tenpenny nail and a hammer in the
good old way to which he was brought up.&nbsp; I vouch for
this.&nbsp; I saw it done.&nbsp; One blow of the hammer and the
tooth was out, while Larry was jumping around holding his
jaw.&nbsp; It is a wonder it wasn&rsquo;t fractured.&nbsp; But
Mr. Pike avers he has removed hundreds of teeth by this method
and never known a fractured jaw.&nbsp; Also, he avers he once
sailed with a skipper who shaved every Sunday morning and never
touched a razor, nor any cutting-edge, to his face.&nbsp; What he
used, according to Mr. Pike, was a lighted candle and a damp
towel.&nbsp; Another candidate for Nietzsche&rsquo;s immortals
who are hard!</p>
<p>As for Mr. Pike himself, he is the highest-spirited,
best-conditioned man on board.&nbsp; The driving to which he
subjected the <i>Elsinore</i> was meat and drink.&nbsp; He still
rubs his hands and chuckles over the memory of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; he said to me, in reference to the crew;
&ldquo;I gave &rsquo;em a taste of real old-fashioned
sailing.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll never forget this hooker&mdash;at
least them that don&rsquo;t take a sack of coal overside before
we reach port.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you think we&rsquo;ll have more
sea-burials?&rdquo; I inquired.</p>
<p>He turned squarely upon me, and squarely looked me in the eyes
for the matter of five long seconds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; he replied, as he turned on his heel.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Hell ain&rsquo;t begun to pop on this hooker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He still stands his mate&rsquo;s watch, alternating with Mr.
Mellaire, for he is firm in his conviction that there is no man
for&rsquo;ard fit to stand a second mate&rsquo;s watch.&nbsp;
Also, he has kept his old quarters.&nbsp; Perhaps it is out of
delicacy for Margaret; for I have learned that it is the
invariable custom for the mate to occupy the captain&rsquo;s
quarters when the latter dies.&nbsp; So Mr. Mellaire still eats
by himself in the big after-room, as he has done since the loss
of the carpenter, and bunks as before in the &rsquo;midship-house
with Nancy.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XLII</h2>
<p>Mr. Mellaire was right.&nbsp; The men would not accept the
driving when the <i>Elsinore</i> won to easier latitudes.&nbsp;
Mr. Pike was right.&nbsp; Hell had not begun to pop.&nbsp; But it
has popped now, and men are overboard without even the kindliness
of a sack of coal at their feet.&nbsp; And yet the men, though
ripe for it, did not precipitate the trouble.&nbsp; It was Mr.
Mellaire.&nbsp; Or, rather, it was Ditman Olansen, the crank-eyed
Norwegian.&nbsp; Perhaps it was Possum.&nbsp; At any rate, it was
an accident, in which the several-named, including Possum, played
their respective parts.</p>
<p>To begin at the beginning.&nbsp; Two weeks have elapsed since
we crossed 50, and we are now in 37&mdash;the same latitude as
San Francisco, or, to be correct, we are as far south of the
equator as San Francisco is north of it.&nbsp; The trouble was
precipitated yesterday morning shortly after nine o&rsquo;clock,
and Possum started the chain of events that culminated in
downright mutiny.&nbsp; It was Mr. Mellaire&rsquo;s watch, and he
was standing on the bridge, directly under the mizzen-top, giving
orders to Sundry Buyers, who, with Arthur Deacon and the Maltese
Cockney, was doing rigging work aloft.</p>
<p>Get the picture and the situation in all its
ridiculousness.&nbsp; Mr. Pike, thermometer in hand, was coming
back along the bridge from taking the temperature of the coal in
the for&rsquo;ard hold.&nbsp; Ditman Olansen was just swinging
into the mizzen-top as he went up with several turns of rope over
one shoulder.&nbsp; Also, in some way, to the end of this rope
was fastened a sizable block that might have weighed ten
pounds.&nbsp; Possum, running free, was fooling around the
chicken-coop on top the &rsquo;midship-house.&nbsp; And the
chickens, featherless but indomitable, were enjoying the milder
weather as they pecked at the grain and grits which the steward
had just placed in their feeding-trough.&nbsp; The tarpaulin that
covered their pen had been off for several days.</p>
<p>Now observe.&nbsp; I am at the break of the poop, leaning on
the rail and watching Ditman Olansen swing into the top with his
cumbersome burden.&nbsp; Mr. Pike, proceeding aft, has just
passed Mr. Mellaire.&nbsp; Possum, who, on account of the Horn
weather and the tarpaulin, has not seen the chickens for many
weeks, is getting reacquainted, and is investigating them with
that keen nose of his.&nbsp; And a hen&rsquo;s beak, equally
though differently keen, impacts on Possum&rsquo;s nose, which is
as sensitive as it is keen.</p>
<p>I may well say, now that I think it over, that it was this
particular hen that started the mutiny.&nbsp; The men,
well-driven by Mr. Pike, were ripe for an explosion, and Possum
and the hen laid the train.</p>
<p>Possum fell away backwards from the coop and loosed a wild cry
of pain and indignation.&nbsp; This attracted Ditman
Olansen&rsquo;s attention.&nbsp; He paused and craned his neck
out in order to see, and, in this moment of carelessness, the
block he was carrying fetched away from him along with the
several turns of rope around his shoulder.&nbsp; Both the mates
sprang away to get out from under.&nbsp; The rope, fast to the
block and following it, lashed about like a blacksnake, and,
though the block fell clear of Mr. Mellaire, the bight of the
rope snatched off his cap.</p>
<p>Mr. Pike had already started an oath aloft when his eyes
caught sight of the terrible cleft in Mr. Mellaire&rsquo;s
head.&nbsp; There it was, for all the world to read, and Mr.
Pike&rsquo;s and mine were the only eyes that could read
it.&nbsp; The sparse hair upon the second mate&rsquo;s crown
served not at all to hide the cleft.&nbsp; It began out of sight
in the thicker hair above the ears, and was exposed nakedly
across the whole dome of head.</p>
<p>The stream of abuse for Ditman Olansen was choked in Mr.
Pike&rsquo;s throat.&nbsp; All he was capable of for the moment
was to stare, petrified, at that enormous fissure flanked at
either end with a thatch of grizzled hair.&nbsp; He was in a
dream, a trance, his great hands knotting and clenching
unconsciously as he stared at the mark unmistakable by which he
had said that he would some day identify the murderer of Captain
Somers.&nbsp; And in that moment I remembered having heard him
declare that some day he would stick his fingers in that
mark.</p>
<p>Still as in a dream, moving slowly, right hand outstretched
like a talon, with the fingers drawn downward, he advanced on the
second mate with the evident intention of thrusting his fingers
into that cleft and of clawing and tearing at the brain-life
beneath that pulsed under the thin film of skin.</p>
<p>The second mate backed away along the bridge, and Mr. Pike
seemed partially to come to himself.&nbsp; His outstretched arm
dropped to his side, and he paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you,&rdquo; he said, in a strange, shaky voice,
blended of age and passion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Eighteen years ago you
were dismasted off the Plate in the <i>Cyrus Thompson</i>.&nbsp;
She foundered, after you were on your beam ends and lost your
sticks.&nbsp; You were in the only boat that was saved.&nbsp;
Eleven years ago, on the <i>Jason Harrison</i>, in San Francisco,
Captain Somers was beaten to death by his second mate.&nbsp; This
second mate was a survivor of the <i>Cyrus Thompson</i>.&nbsp;
This second mate&rsquo;d had his skull split by a crazy
sea-cook.&nbsp; Your skull is split.&nbsp; This second
mate&rsquo;s name was Sidney Waltham.&nbsp; And if you
ain&rsquo;t Sidney Waltham . . . &rdquo;</p>
<p>At this point Mr. Mellaire, or, rather, Sidney Waltham,
despite his fifty years, did what only a sailor could do.&nbsp;
He went over the bridge-rail side-wise, caught the running gear
up-and-down the mizzen-mast, and landed lightly on his feet on
top of Number Three hatch.&nbsp; Nor did he stop there.&nbsp; He
ran across the hatch and dived through the doorway of his room in
the &rsquo;midship-house.</p>
<p>Such must have been Mr. Pike&rsquo;s profundity of passion,
that he paused like a somnambulist, actually rubbed his eyes with
the back of his hand, and seemed to awaken.</p>
<p>But the second mate had not run to his room for refuge.&nbsp;
The next moment he emerged, a thirty-two Smith and Wesson in his
hand, and the instant he emerged he began shooting.</p>
<p>Mr. Pike was wholly himself again, and I saw him perceptibly
pause and decide between the two impulses that tore at him.&nbsp;
One was to leap over the bridge-rail and down at the man who shot
at him; the other was to retreat.&nbsp; He retreated.&nbsp; And
as he bounded aft along the narrow bridge the mutiny began.&nbsp;
Arthur Deacon, from the mizzen-top, leaned out and hurled a steel
marlin-spike at the fleeing mate.&nbsp; The thing flashed in the
sunlight as it hurtled down.&nbsp; It missed Mr. Pike by twenty
feet and nearly impaled Possum, who, afraid of firearms, was
wildly rushing and ki-yi-ing aft.&nbsp; It so happened that the
sharp point of the marlin-spike struck the wooden floor of the
bridge, and it penetrated the planking with such force that after
it had fetched to a standstill it vibrated violently for long
seconds.</p>
<p>I confess that I failed to observe a tithe of what occurred
during the next several minutes.&nbsp; Piece together as I will,
after the event, I know that I missed much of what took
place.&nbsp; I know that the men aloft in the mizzen descended to
the deck, but I never saw them descend.&nbsp; I know that the
second mate emptied the chambers of his revolver, but I did not
hear all the shots.&nbsp; I know that Lars Johnson left the
wheel, and on his broken leg, rebroken and not yet really mended,
limped and scuttled across the poop, down the ladder, and gained
for&rsquo;ard.&nbsp; I know he must have limped and scuttled on
that bad leg of his; I know that I must have seen him; and yet I
swear that I have no impression of seeing him.</p>
<p>I do know that I heard the rush of feet of men from
for&rsquo;ard along the main deck.&nbsp; And I do know that I saw
Mr. Pike take shelter behind the steel jiggermast.&nbsp; Also, as
the second mate manoeuvred to port on top of Number Three hatch
for his last shot, I know that I saw Mr. Pike duck around the
corner of the chart-house to starboard and get away aft and below
by way of the booby-hatch.&nbsp; And I did hear that last futile
shot, and the bullet also as it ricochetted from the corner of
the steel-walled chart-house.</p>
<p>As for myself, I did not move.&nbsp; I was too interested in
seeing.&nbsp; It may have been due to lack of presence of mind,
or to lack of habituation to an active part in scenes of quick
action; but at any rate I merely retained my position at the
break of the poop and looked on.&nbsp; I was the only person on
the poop when the mutineers, led by the second mate and the
gangsters, rushed it.&nbsp; I saw them swarm up the ladder, and
it never entered my head to attempt to oppose them.&nbsp; Which
was just as well, for I would have been killed for my pains, and
I could never have stopped them.</p>
<p>I was alone on the poop, and the men were quite perplexed to
find no enemy in sight.&nbsp; As Bert Rhine went past, he half
fetched up in his stride, as if to knife me with the sheath
knife, sharp-pointed, which he carried in his right hand; then,
and I know I correctly measured the drift of his judgment, he
unflatteringly dismissed me as unimportant and ran on.</p>
<p>Right here I was impressed by the lack of clear-thinking on
any of their parts.&nbsp; So spontaneously had the ship&rsquo;s
company exploded into mutiny that it was dazed and confused even
while it acted.&nbsp; For instance, in the months since we left
Baltimore there had never been a moment, day or night, even when
preventer tackles were rigged, that a man had not stood at the
wheel.&nbsp; So habituated were they to this, that they were
shocked into consternation at sight of the deserted wheel.&nbsp;
They paused for an instant to stare at it.&nbsp; Then Bert Rhine,
with a quick word and gesture, sent the Italian, Guido Bombini,
around the rear of the half-wheelhouse.&nbsp; The fact that he
completed the circuit was proof that nobody was there.</p>
<p>Again, in the swift rush of events, I must confess that I saw
but little.&nbsp; I was aware that more of the men were climbing
up the ladder and gaining the poop, but I had no eyes for
them.&nbsp; I was watching that sanguinary group aft near the
wheel and noting the most important thing, namely, that it was
Bert Rhine, the gangster, and not the second mate, who gave
orders and was obeyed.</p>
<p>He motioned to the Jew, Isaac Chantz, who had been wounded
earlier in the voyage by O&rsquo;Sullivan, and Chantz led the way
to the starboard chart-house door.&nbsp; While this was going on,
all in flashing fractions of seconds, Bert Rhine was cautiously
inspecting the lazarette through the open booby-hatch.</p>
<p>Isaac Chantz jerked open the chart-house door, which swung
outward.&nbsp; Things did happen so swiftly!&nbsp; As he jerked
the iron door open a two-foot hacking butcher knife, at the end
of a withered, yellow hand, flashed out and down on him.&nbsp; It
missed head and neck, but caught him on top of the left
shoulder.</p>
<p>All hands recoiled before this, and the Jew reeled across to
the rail, his right hand clutching at his wound, and between the
fingers I could see the blood welling darkly.&nbsp; Bert Rhine
abandoned his inspection of the booby-hatch, and, with the second
mate, the latter still carrying his empty Smith &amp; Wesson,
sprang into the press about the chart-house door.</p>
<p>O wise, clever, cautious, old Chinese steward!&nbsp; He made
no emergence.&nbsp; The door swung emptily back and forth to the
rolling of the <i>Elsinore</i>, and no man knew but what, just
inside, with that heavy, hacking knife upraised, lurked the
steward.&nbsp; And while they hesitated and stared at the
aperture that alternately closed and opened with the swinging of
the door, the booby-hatch, situated between chart-house and
wheel, erupted.&nbsp; It was Mr. Pike, with his .44 automatic
Colt.</p>
<p>There were shots fired, other than by him.&nbsp; I know I
heard them, like &ldquo;red-heads&rdquo; at an old-time Fourth of
July; but I do not know who discharged them.&nbsp; All was mess
and confusion.&nbsp; Many shots were being fired, and through the
uproar I heard the reiterant, monotonous explosions from the
Colt&rsquo;s .44</p>
<p>I saw the Italian, Mike Cipriani, clutch savagely at his
abdomen and sink slowly to the deck.&nbsp; Shorty, the Japanese
half-caste, clown that he was, dancing and grinning on the
outskirts of the struggle, with a final grimace and hysterical
giggle led the retreat across the poop and down the
poop-ladder.&nbsp; Never had I seen a finer exemplification of
mob psychology.&nbsp; Shorty, the most unstable-minded of the
individuals who composed this mob, by his own instability
precipitated the retreat in which the mob joined.&nbsp; When he
broke before the steady discharge of the automatic in the hand of
the mate, on the instant the rest broke with him.&nbsp;
Least-balanced, his balance was the balance of all of them.</p>
<p>Chantz, bleeding prodigiously, was one of the first on
Shorty&rsquo;s heels.&nbsp; I saw Nosey Murphy pause long enough
to throw his knife at the mate.&nbsp; The missile went wide, with
a metallic clang struck the brass tip of one of the spokes of the
<i>Elsinore&rsquo;s</i> wheel, and clattered on the deck.&nbsp;
The second mate, with his empty revolver, and Bert Rhine with his
sheath-knife, fled past me side by side.</p>
<p>Mr. Pike emerged from the booby-hatch and with an unaimed shot
brought down Bill Quigley, one of the &ldquo;bricklayers,&rdquo;
who fell at my feet.&nbsp; The last man off the poop was the
Maltese Cockney, and at the top of the ladder he paused to look
back at Mr. Pike, who, holding the automatic in both hands, was
taking careful aim.&nbsp; The Maltese Cockney, disdaining the
ladder, leaped through the air to the main deck.&nbsp; But the
Colt merely clicked.&nbsp; It was the last bullet in it that had
fetched down Bill Quigley.</p>
<p>And the poop was ours.</p>
<p>Events still crowded so closely that I missed much.&nbsp; I
saw the steward, belligerent and cautious, his long knife poised
for a slash, emerge from the chart-house.&nbsp; Margaret followed
him, and behind her came Wada, who carried my .22 Winchester
automatic rifle.&nbsp; As he told me afterwards, he had brought
it up under instructions from her.</p>
<p>Mr. Pike was glancing with cool haste at his Colt to see
whether it was jammed or empty, when Margaret asked him the
course.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the wind,&rdquo; he shouted to her, as he bounded
for&rsquo;ard.&nbsp; &ldquo;Put your helm hard up or we&rsquo;ll
be all aback.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ah!&mdash;yeoman and henchman of the race, he could not fail
in his fidelity to the ship under his command.&nbsp; The iron of
all his years of iron training was there manifest.&nbsp; While
mutiny spread red, and death was on the wing, he could not forget
his charge, the ship, the <i>Elsinore</i>, the insensate fabric
compounded of steel and hemp and woven cotton that was to him
glorious with personality.</p>
<p>Margaret waved Wada in my direction as she ran to the
wheel.&nbsp; As Mr. Pike passed the corner of the chart-house,
simultaneously there was a report from amidships and the ping of
a bullet against the steel wall.&nbsp; I saw the man who fired
the shot.&nbsp; It was the cowboy, Steve Roberts.</p>
<p>As for the mate, he ducked in behind the sheltering
jiggermast, and even as he ducked his left hand dipped into his
side coat-pocket, so that when he had gained shelter it was
coming out with a fresh clip of cartridges.&nbsp; The empty clip
fell to the deck, the loader clip slipped up the hollow butt, and
he was good for eight more shots.</p>
<p>Wada turned the little automatic rifle over to me, where I
still stood under the weather cloth at the break of the poop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All ready,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You take off
safety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get Roberts,&rdquo; Mr. Pike called to me.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the best shot for&rsquo;ard.&nbsp; If you
can&rsquo;t get &rsquo;m, jolt the fear of God into him
anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the first time I had a human target, and let me say,
here and now, that I am convinced I am immune to buck
fever.&nbsp; There he was before me, less than a hundred feet
distant, in the gangway between the door to Davis&rsquo; room and
the starboard-rail, manoeuvring for another shot at Mr. Pike.</p>
<p>I must have missed Steve Roberts that first time, but I came
so near him that he jumped.&nbsp; The next instant he had located
me and turned his revolver on me.&nbsp; But he had no
chance.&nbsp; My little automatic was discharging as fast as I
could tickle the trigger with my fore-finger.&nbsp; The
cowboy&rsquo;s first shot went wild of me, because my bullet
arrived ere he got his swift aim.&nbsp; He swayed and stumbled
backward, but the bullets&mdash;ten of them&mdash;poured from the
muzzle of my Winchester like water from a garden hose.&nbsp; It
was a stream of lead I played upon him.&nbsp; I shall never know
how many times I hit him, but I am confident that after he had
begun his long staggering fall at least three additional bullets
entered him ere he impacted on the deck.&nbsp; And even as he was
falling, aimlessly and mechanically, stricken then with death, he
managed twice again to discharge his weapon.</p>
<p>And after he struck the deck he never moved.&nbsp; I do
believe he died in the air.</p>
<p>As I held up my gun and gazed at the abruptly-deserted
main-deck I was aware of Wada&rsquo;s touch on my arm.&nbsp; I
looked.&nbsp; In his hand were a dozen little .22 long,
soft-nosed, smokeless cartridges.&nbsp; He wanted me to
reload.&nbsp; I threw on the safety, opened the magazine, and
tilted the rifle so that he could let the fresh cartridges of
themselves slide into place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get some more,&rdquo; I told him.</p>
<p>Scarcely had he departed on the errand when Bill Quigley, who
lay at my feet, created a diversion.&nbsp; I jumped&mdash;yes,
and I freely confess that I yelled&mdash;with startle and
surprise, when I felt his paws clutch my ankles and his teeth
shut down on the calf of my leg.</p>
<p>It was Mr. Pike to the rescue.&nbsp; I understand now the
Western hyperbole of &ldquo;hitting the high places.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The mate did not seem in contact with the deck.&nbsp; My
impression was that he soared through the air to me, landing
beside me, and, in the instant of landing, kicking out with one
of those big feet of his.&nbsp; Bill Quigley was kicked clear
away from me, and the next moment he was flying overboard.&nbsp;
It was a clean throw.&nbsp; He never touched the rail.</p>
<p>Whether Mike Cipriani, who, till then, had lain in a welter,
began crawling aft in quest of safety, or whether he intended
harm to Margaret at the wheel, we shall never know; for there was
no opportunity given him to show his purpose.&nbsp; As swiftly as
Mr. Pike could cross the deck with those giant bounds, just that
swiftly was the Italian in the air and following Bill Quigley
overside.</p>
<p>The mate missed nothing with those eagle eyes of his as he
returned along the poop.&nbsp; Nobody was to be seen on the main
deck.&nbsp; Even the lookout had deserted the forecastle-head,
and the <i>Elsinore</i>, steered by Margaret, slipped a lazy two
knots through the quiet sea.&nbsp; Mr. Pike was apprehensive of a
shot from ambush, and it was not until after a scrutiny of
several minutes that he put his pistol into his side coat-pocket
and snarled for&rsquo;ard:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come out, you rats!&nbsp; Show your ugly faces!&nbsp; I
want to talk with you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guido Bombini, gesticulating peaceable intentions and
evidently thrust out by Bert Rhine, was the first to
appear.&nbsp; When it was observed that Mr. Pike did not fire,
the rest began to dribble into view.&nbsp; This continued till
all were there save the cook, the two sail-makers, and the second
mate.&nbsp; The last to come out were Tom Spink, the boy
Buckwheat, and Herman Lunkenheimer, the good-natured but
simple-minded German; and these three came out only after
repeated threats from Bert Rhine, who, with Nosey Murphy and Kid
Twist, was patently in charge.&nbsp; Also, like a faithful dog,
Guido Bombini fawned close to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will do&mdash;stop where you are,&rdquo; Mr. Pike
commanded, when the crew was scattered abreast, to starboard and
to port, of Number Three hatch.</p>
<p>It was a striking scene.&nbsp; <i>Mutiny on the high
seas</i>!&nbsp; That phrase, learned in boyhood from my Marryatt
and Cooper, recrudesced in my brain.&nbsp; This was
it&mdash;mutiny on the high seas in the year nineteen
thirteen&mdash;and I was part of it, a perishing blond whose lot
was cast with the perishing but lordly blonds, and I had already
killed a man.</p>
<p>Mr. Pike, in the high place, aged and indomitable; leaned his
arm on the rail at the break of the poop and gazed down at the
mutineers, the like of which I&rsquo;ll wager had never been
assembled in mutiny before.&nbsp; There were the three gangsters
and ex-jailbirds, anything but seamen, yet in control of this
affair that was peculiarly an affair of the sea.&nbsp; With them
was the Italian hound, Bombini, and beside them were such
strangely assorted men as Anton Sorensen, Lars Jacobsen, Frank
Fitzgibbon, and Richard Giller&mdash;also Arthur Deacon the white
slaver, John Hackey the San Francisco hoodlum, the Maltese
Cockney, and Tony the suicidal Greek.</p>
<p>I noticed the three strange ones, shouldering together and
standing apart from the others as they swayed to the lazy roll
and dreamed with their pale, topaz eyes.&nbsp; And there was the
Faun, stone deaf but observant, straining to understand what was
taking place.&nbsp; Yes, and Mulligan Jacobs and Andy Fay were
bitterly and eagerly side by side, and Ditman Olansen,
crank-eyed, as if drawn by some affinity of bitterness, stood
behind them, his head appearing between their heads.&nbsp;
Farthest advanced of all was Charles Davis, the man who by all
rights should long since be dead, his face with its wax-like
pallor startlingly in contrast to the weathered faces of the
rest.</p>
<p>I glanced back at Margaret, who was coolly steering, and she
smiled to me, and love was in her eyes&mdash;she, too, of the
perishing and lordly race of blonds, her place the high place,
her heritage government and command and mastery over the stupid
lowly of her kind and over the ruck and spawn of the
dark-pigmented breeds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Sidney Waltham?&rdquo; the mate
snarled.&nbsp; &ldquo;I want him.&nbsp; Bring him out.&nbsp;
After that, the rest of you filth get back to work, or God have
mercy on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men moved about restlessly, shuffling their feet on the
deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sidney Waltham, I want you&mdash;come out!&rdquo; Mr.
Pike called, addressing himself beyond them to the murderer of
the captain under whom once he had sailed.</p>
<p>The prodigious old hero!&nbsp; It never entered his head that
he was not the master of the rabble there below him.&nbsp; He had
but one idea, an idea of passion, and that was his desire for
vengeance on the murderer of his old skipper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You old stiff!&rdquo; Mulligan Jacobs snarled back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up, Mulligan!&rdquo; was Bert Rhine&rsquo;s
command, in receipt of which he received a venomous stare from
the cripple.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, ho, my hearty,&rdquo; Mr. Pike sneered at the
gangster.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care of your case, never
fear.&nbsp; In the meantime, and right now, fetch out that
dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon he ignored the leader of the mutineers and began
calling, &ldquo;Waltham, you dog, come out!&nbsp; Come out, you
sneaking cur!&nbsp; Come out!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Another lunatic</i>, was the thought that flashed through
my mind; another lunatic, the slave of a single idea.&nbsp; He
forgets the mutiny, his fidelity to the ship, in his personal
thirst for vengeance.</p>
<p>But did he?&nbsp; Even as he forgot and called his
heart&rsquo;s desire, which was the life of the second mate, even
then, without intention, mechanically, his sailor&rsquo;s
considerative eye lifted to note the draw of the sails and roved
from sail to sail.&nbsp; Thereupon, so reminded, he returned to
his fidelity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he snarled at Bert Rhine.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go
on and get for&rsquo;ard before I spit on you, you scum and
slum.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll give you and the rest of the rats two
minutes to return to duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the leader, with his two fellow-gangsters, laughed their
weird, silent laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;ll listen to our talk, first, old
horse,&rdquo; Bert Rhine retorted.&nbsp; &ldquo;&mdash;Davis, get
up now and show what kind of a spieler you are.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
get cold feet.&nbsp; Spit it out to Foxy Grandpa an&rsquo; tell
&rsquo;m what&rsquo;s doin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You damned sea-lawyer!&rdquo; Mr. Pike snarled as Davis
opened his mouth to speak.</p>
<p>Bert Rhine shrugged his shoulders, and half turned on his heel
as if to depart, as he said quietly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, if you don&rsquo;t want to talk . . .
&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Pike conceded a point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; he snarled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Spit the dirt
out of your system, Davis; but remember one thing: you&rsquo;ll
pay for this, and you&rsquo;ll pay through the nose.&nbsp; Go
on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sea-lawyer cleared his throat in preparation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First of all, I ain&rsquo;t got no part in this,&rdquo;
he began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a sick man, an&rsquo; I oughta be in my bunk
right now.&nbsp; I ain&rsquo;t fit to be on my feet.&nbsp; But
they&rsquo;ve asked me to advise &rsquo;em on the law, an&rsquo;
I have advised &rsquo;em&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the law&mdash;what is it?&rdquo; Mr. Pike broke
in.</p>
<p>But Davis was uncowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The law is that when the officers is inefficient, the
crew can take charge peaceably an&rsquo; bring the ship into
port.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s all law an&rsquo; in the records.&nbsp;
There was the <i>Abyssinia</i>, in eighteen ninety-two, when the
master&rsquo;d died of fever and the mates took to
drinkin&rsquo;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; Mr. Pike shut him off.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t want your citations.&nbsp; What d&rsquo;ye
want?&nbsp; Spit it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;and I&rsquo;m talkin&rsquo; as an outsider,
as a sick man off duty that&rsquo;s been asked to
talk&mdash;well, the point is our skipper was a good one, but
he&rsquo;s gone.&nbsp; Our mate is violent, seekin&rsquo; the
life of the second mate.&nbsp; We don&rsquo;t care about
that.&nbsp; What we want is to get into port with our
lives.&nbsp; An&rsquo; our lives is in danger.&nbsp; We
ain&rsquo;t hurt nobody.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve done all the
bloodshed.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve shot an&rsquo; killed an&rsquo;
thrown two men overboard, as witnesses&rsquo;ll testify to in
court.&nbsp; An&rsquo; there&rsquo;s Roberts, there, dead, too,
an&rsquo; headin&rsquo; for the sharks&mdash;an&rsquo; what
for?&nbsp; For defendin&rsquo; himself from murderous an&rsquo;
deadly attack, as every man can testify an&rsquo; tell the truth,
the whole truth, an&rsquo; nothin&rsquo; but the truth, so help
&rsquo;m, God&mdash;ain&rsquo;t that right, men?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A confused murmur of assent arose from many of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want my job, eh?&rdquo; Mr. Pike grinned.&nbsp;
&ldquo;An&rsquo; what are you goin&rsquo; to do with
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be taken care of until we get in an&rsquo;
turn you over to the lawful authorities,&rdquo; Davis answered
promptly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Most likely you can plead insanity
an&rsquo; get off easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment I felt a stir at my shoulder.&nbsp; It was
Margaret, armed with the long knife of the steward, whom she had
put at the wheel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got another guess comin&rsquo;,
Davis,&rdquo; Mr. Pike said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got no more
talk with you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to talk to the
bunch.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll give you fellows just two minutes to
choose, and I&rsquo;ll tell you your choices.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve
only got two choices.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll turn the second mate
over to me an&rsquo; go back to duty and take what&rsquo;s
comin&rsquo; to you, or you&rsquo;ll go to jail with the stripes
on you for long sentences.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve got two
minutes.&nbsp; The fellows that want jail can stand right where
they are.&nbsp; The fellows that don&rsquo;t want jail and are
willin&rsquo; to work faithful, can walk right back to me here on
the poop.&nbsp; Two minutes, an&rsquo; you can keep your jaws
stopped while you think over what it&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to
be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned his head to me and said in an undertone, &ldquo;Be
ready with that pop-gun for trouble.&nbsp; An&rsquo; don&rsquo;t
hesitate.&nbsp; Slap it into &rsquo;em&mdash;the swine that think
they can put as raw a deal as this over on us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Buckwheat who made the first move; but so tentative was
it that it got no farther than a tensing of the legs and a sway
forward of the shoulders.&nbsp; Nevertheless it was sufficient to
start Herman Lunkenheimer, who thrust out his foot and began
confidently to walk aft.&nbsp; Kid Twist gained him in a single
spring, and Kid Twist, his wrist under the German&rsquo;s throat
from behind; his knee pressed into the German&rsquo;s back, bent
the man backward and held him.&nbsp; Even as the rifle came to my
shoulder, the hound Bombini drew his knife directly beneath Kid
Twist&rsquo;s wrist across the up-stretched throat of the
man.</p>
<p>It was at this instant that I heard Mr. Pike&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Plug him!&rdquo; and pulled the trigger; and of all
ungodly things the bullet missed and caught the Faun, who
staggered back, sat down on the hatch, and began to cough.&nbsp;
And even as he coughed he still strained with pain-eloquent eyes
to try to understand.</p>
<p>No other man moved.&nbsp; Herman Lunkenheimer, released by Kid
Twist, sank down on the deck.&nbsp; Nor did I shoot again.&nbsp;
Kid Twist stood again by the side of Bert Rhine and Guido Bombini
fawned near.</p>
<p>Bert Rhine actually visibly smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any more of you guys want to promenade aft?&rdquo; he
queried in velvet tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two minutes up,&rdquo; Mr. Pike declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; what are you goin&rsquo; to do about it,
Grandpa?&rdquo; Bert Rhine sneered.</p>
<p>In a flash the big automatic was out of the mate&rsquo;s
pocket and he was shooting as fast as he could pull trigger,
while all hands fled to shelter.&nbsp; But, as he had long since
told me, he was no shot and could effectively use the weapon only
at close range&mdash;muzzle to stomach preferably.</p>
<p>As we stared at the main deck, deserted save for the dead
cowboy on his back and for the Faun who still sat on the hatch
and coughed, an eruption of men occurred over the for&rsquo;ard
edge of the &rsquo;midship-house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shoot!&rdquo; Margaret cried at my back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Mr. Pike roared at me.</p>
<p>The rifle was at my shoulder when I desisted.&nbsp; Louis, the
cook, led the rush aft to us across the top of the house and
along the bridge.&nbsp; Behind him, in single file and not
wasting any time, came the Japanese sail-makers, Henry the
training-ship boy, and the other boy Buckwheat.&nbsp; Tom Spink
brought up the rear.&nbsp; As he came up the ladder of the
&rsquo;midship-house somebody from beneath must have caught him
by a leg in an effort to drag him back.&nbsp; We saw half of him
in sight and knew that he was struggling and kicking.&nbsp; He
fetched clear abruptly, gained the top of the house in a surge,
and raced aft along the bridge until he overtook and collided
with Buckwheat, who yelled out in fear that a mutineer had caught
him.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XLIII</h2>
<p>We who are aft, besieged in the high place, are stronger in
numbers than I dreamed until now, when I have just finished
taking the ship&rsquo;s census.&nbsp; Of course Margaret, Mr.
Pike, and myself are apart.&nbsp; We alone represent the ruling
class.&nbsp; With us are servants and serfs, faithful to their
salt, who look to us for guidance and life.</p>
<p>I use my words advisedly.&nbsp; Tom Spink and Buckwheat are
serfs and nothing else.&nbsp; Henry, the training-ship boy,
occupies an anomalous classification.&nbsp; He is of our kind,
but he can scarcely be called even a cadet of our kind.&nbsp; He
will some day win to us and become a mate or a captain, but in
the meantime, of course, his past is against him.&nbsp; He is a
candidate, rising from the serf class to our class.&nbsp; Also,
he is only a youth, the iron of his heredity not yet tested and
proven.</p>
<p>Wada, Louis, and the steward are servants of Asiatic
breed.&nbsp; So are the two Japanese sail-makers&mdash;scarcely
servants, not to be called slaves, but something in between.</p>
<p>So, all told, there are eleven of us aft in the citadel.&nbsp;
But our followers are too servant-like and serf-like to be
offensive fighters.&nbsp; They will help us defend the high place
against all attack; but they are incapable of joining with us in
an attack on the other end of the ship.&nbsp; They will fight
like cornered rats to preserve their lives; but they will not
advance like tigers upon the enemy.&nbsp; Tom Spink is faithful
but spirit-broken.&nbsp; Buckwheat is hopelessly of the stupid
lowly.&nbsp; Henry has not yet won his spurs.&nbsp; On our side
remain Margaret, Mr. Pike, and myself.&nbsp; The rest will hold
the wall of the poop and fight thereon to the death, but they are
not to be depended upon in a sortie.</p>
<p>At the other end of the ship&mdash;and I may as well give the
roster, are: the second mate, either to be called Mellaire or
Waltham, a strong man of our own breed but a renegade; the three
gangsters, killers and jackals, Bert Rhine, Nosey Murphy, and Kid
Twist; the Maltese Cockney and Tony the crazy Greek; Frank
Fitzgibbon and Richard Giller, the survivors of the trio of
&ldquo;bricklayers&rdquo;; Anton Sorensen and Lars Jacobsen,
stupid Scandinavian sailor-men; Ditman Olansen, the crank-eyed
Berserk; John Hackey and Arthur Deacon, respectively hoodlum and
white slaver; Shorty, the mixed-breed clown; Guido Bombini, the
Italian hound; Andy Pay and Mulligan Jacobs, the bitter ones; the
three topaz-eyed dreamers, who are unclassifiable; Isaac Chantz,
the wounded Jew; Bob, the overgrown dolt; the feeble-minded Faun,
lung-wounded; Nancy and Sundry Buyers, the two hopeless, helpless
bosuns; and, finally, the sea-lawyer, Charles Davis.</p>
<p>This makes twenty-seven of them against the eleven of
us.&nbsp; But there are men, strong in viciousness, among
them.&nbsp; They, too, have their serfs and bravos.&nbsp; Guido
Bombini and Isaac Chantz are certainly bravos.&nbsp; And
weaklings like Sorensen, and Jacobsen, and Bob, cannot be
anything else than slaves to the men who compose the gangster
clique.</p>
<p>I failed to tell what happened yesterday, after Mr. Pike
emptied his automatic and cleared the deck.&nbsp; The poop was
indubitably ours, and there was no possibility of the mutineers
making a charge on us in broad daylight.&nbsp; Margaret had gone
below, accompanied by Wada, to see to the security of the port
and starboard doors that open from the cabin directly on the main
deck.&nbsp; These are still caulked and tight and fastened on the
inside, as they have been since the passage of Cape Horn
began.</p>
<p>Mr. Pike put one of the sail-makers at the wheel, and the
steward, relieved and starting below, was attracted to the port
quarter, where the patent log that towed astern was made
fast.&nbsp; Margaret had returned his knife to him, and he was
carrying it in his hand when his attention was attracted astern
to our wake.&nbsp; Mike Cipriani and Bill Quigley had managed to
catch the lazily moving log-line and were clinging to it.&nbsp;
The <i>Elsinore</i> was moving just fast enough to keep them on
the surface instead of dragging them under.&nbsp; Above them and
about them circled curious and hungry albatrosses, Cape hens, and
mollyhawks.&nbsp; Even as I glimpsed the situation one of the big
birds, a ten-footer at least, with a ten-inch beak to the fore,
dropped down on the Italian.&nbsp; Releasing his hold with one
hand, he struck with his knife at the bird.&nbsp; Feathers flew,
and the albatross, deflected by the blow, fell clumsily into the
water.</p>
<p>Quite methodically, just as part of the day&rsquo;s work, the
steward chopped down with his knife, catching the log-line
between the steel edge and the rail.&nbsp; At once, no longer
buoyed up by the <i>Elsinore&rsquo;s</i> two-knot drag ahead, the
wounded men began to swim and flounder.&nbsp; The circling hosts
of huge sea-birds descended upon them, with carnivorous beaks
striking at their heads and shoulders and arms.&nbsp; A great
screeching and squawking arose from the winged things of prey as
they strove for the living meat.&nbsp; And yet, somehow, I was
not very profoundly shocked.&nbsp; These were the men whom I had
seen eviscerate the shark and toss it overboard, and shout with
joy as they watched it devoured alive by its brethren.&nbsp; They
had played a violent, cruel game with the things of life, and the
things of life now played upon them the same violent, cruel
game.&nbsp; As they that rise by the sword perish by the sword,
just so did these two men who had lived cruelly die cruelly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; was Mr. Pike&rsquo;s comment,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ve saved two sacks of mighty good
coal.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Certainly our situation might be worse.&nbsp; We are cooking
on the coal-stove and on the oil-burners.&nbsp; We have servants
to cook and serve for us.&nbsp; And, most important of all, we
are in possession of all the food on the <i>Elsinore</i>.</p>
<p>Mr. Pike makes no mistake.&nbsp; Realizing that with our crowd
we cannot rush the crowd at the other end of the ship, he accepts
the siege, which, as he says, consists of the besieged holding
all food supplies while the besiegers are on the imminent edge of
famine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Starve the dogs,&rdquo; he growls.&nbsp; &ldquo;Starve
&rsquo;m until they crawl aft and lick our shoes.&nbsp; Maybe you
think the custom of carrying the stores aft just happened.&nbsp;
Only it didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Before you and I were born it was
long-established and it was established on brass tacks.&nbsp;
They knew what they were about, the old cusses, when they put the
grub in the lazarette.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louis says there is not more than three days&rsquo; regular
whack in the galley; that the barrel of hard-tack in the
forecastle will quickly go; and that our chickens, which they
stole last night from the top of the &rsquo;midship-house, are
equivalent to no more than an additional day&rsquo;s
supply.&nbsp; In short, at the outside limit, we are convinced
the men will be keen to talk surrender within the week.</p>
<p>We are no longer sailing.&nbsp; In last night&rsquo;s darkness
we helplessly listened to the men loosing headsail-halyards and
letting yards go down on the run.&nbsp; Under orders of Mr. Pike
I shot blindly and many times into the dark, but without result,
save that we heard the bullets of answering shots strike against
the chart-house.&nbsp; So to-day we have not even a man at the
wheel.&nbsp; The <i>Elsinore</i> drifts idly on an idle sea, and
we stand regular watches in the shelter of chart-house and
jiggermast.&nbsp; Mr. Pike says it is the laziest time he has had
on the whole voyage.</p>
<p>I alternate watches with him, although when on duty there is
little to be done, save, in the daytime, to stand rifle in hand
behind the jiggermast, and, in the night, to lurk along the break
of the poop.&nbsp; Behind the chart-house, ready to repel
assault, are my watch of four men: Tom Spink, Wada, Buckwheat,
and Louis.&nbsp; Henry, the two Japanese sail-makers, and the old
steward compose Mr. Pike&rsquo;s watch.</p>
<p>It is his orders that no one for&rsquo;ard is to be allowed to
show himself, so, to-day, when the second mate appeared at the
corner of the &rsquo;midship-house, I made him take a quick leap
back with the thud of my bullet against the iron wall a foot from
his head.&nbsp; Charles David tried the same game and was
similarly stimulated.</p>
<p>Also, this evening, after dark, Mr. Pike put block-and-tackle
on the first section of the bridge, heaved it out of place, and
lowered it upon the poop.&nbsp; Likewise he hoisted in the ladder
at the break of the poop that leads down to the main deck.&nbsp;
The men will have to do some climbing if they ever elect to rush
us.</p>
<p>I am writing this in my watch below.&nbsp; I came off duty at
eight o&rsquo;clock, and at midnight I go on deck to stay till
four to-morrow morning.&nbsp; Wada shakes his head and says that
the Blackwood Company should rebate us on the first-class passage
paid in advance.&nbsp; We are working our passage, he
contends.</p>
<p>Margaret takes the adventure joyously.&nbsp; It is the first
time she has experienced mutiny, but she is such a thorough
sea-woman that she appears like an old hand at the game.&nbsp;
She leaves the deck to the mate and me; but, still acknowledging
his leadership, she has taken charge below and entirely manages
the commissary, the cooking, and the sleeping arrangements.&nbsp;
We still keep our old quarters, and she has bedded the new-comers
in the big after-room with blankets issued from the
slop-chest.</p>
<p>In a way, from the standpoint of her personal welfare, the
mutiny is the best thing that could have happened to her.&nbsp;
It has taken her mind off her father and filled her waking hours
with work to do.&nbsp; This afternoon, standing above the open
booby-hatch, I heard her laugh ring out as in the old days coming
down the Atlantic.&nbsp; Yes, and she hums snatches of songs
under her breath as she works.&nbsp; In the second dog-watch this
evening, after Mr. Pike had finished dinner and joined us on the
poop, she told him that if he did not soon re-rig his phonograph
she was going to start in on the piano.&nbsp; The reason she
advanced was the psychological effect such sounds of revelry
would have on the starving mutineers.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>The days pass, and nothing of moment happens.&nbsp; We get
nowhere.&nbsp; The <i>Elsinore</i>, without the steadying of her
canvas, rolls emptily and drifts a lunatic course.&nbsp;
Sometimes she is bow on to the wind, and at other times she is
directly before it; but at all times she is circling vaguely and
hesitantly to get somewhere else than where she is.&nbsp; As an
illustration, at daylight this morning she came up into the wind
as if endeavouring to go about.&nbsp; In the course of half an
hour she worked off till the wind was directly abeam.&nbsp; In
another half hour she was back into the wind.&nbsp; Not until
evening did she manage to get the wind on her port bow; but when
she did, she immediately paid off, accomplished the complete
circle in an hour, and recommenced her morning tactics of trying
to get into the wind.</p>
<p>And there is nothing for us to do save hold the poop against
the attack that is never made.&nbsp; Mr. Pike, more from force of
habit than anything else, takes his regular observations and
works up the <i>Elsinore&rsquo;s</i> position.&nbsp; This noon
she was eight miles east of yesterday&rsquo;s position, yet
to-day&rsquo;s position, in longitude, was within a mile of where
she was four days ago.&nbsp; On the other hand she invariably
makes nothing at the rate of seven or eight miles a day.</p>
<p>Aloft, the <i>Elsinore</i> is a sad spectacle.&nbsp; All is
confusion and disorder.&nbsp; The sails, unfurled, are a slovenly
mess along the yards, and many loose ends sway dismally to every
roll.&nbsp; The only yard that is loose is the main-yard.&nbsp;
It is fortunate that wind and wave are mild, else would the
iron-work carry away and the mutineers find the huge thing of
steel about their ears.</p>
<p>There is one thing we cannot understand.&nbsp; A week has
passed, and the men show no signs of being starved into
submission.&nbsp; Repeatedly and in vain has Mr. Pike
interrogated the hands aft with us.&nbsp; One and all, from the
cook to Buckwheat, they swear they have no knowledge of any food
for&rsquo;ard, save the small supply in the galley and the barrel
of hardtack in the forecastle.&nbsp; Yet it is very evident that
those for&rsquo;ard are not starving.&nbsp; We see the smoke from
the galley-stove and can only conclude that they have food to
cook.</p>
<p>Twice has Bert Rhine attempted a truce, but both times his
white flag, as soon as it showed above the edge of the
&rsquo;midship-house, was fired upon by Mr. Pike.&nbsp; The last
occurrence was two days ago.&nbsp; It is Mr. Pike&rsquo;s
intention thoroughly to starve them into submission, but now he
is beginning to worry about their mysterious food supply.</p>
<p>Mr. Pike is not quite himself.&nbsp; He is obsessed, I know
beyond any doubt, with the idea of vengeance on the second
mate.&nbsp; On divers occasions, now, I have come unexpectedly
upon him and found him muttering to himself with grim set face,
or clenching and unclenching his big square fists and grinding
his teeth.&nbsp; His conversation continually runs upon the
feasibility of our making a night attack for&rsquo;ard, and he is
perpetually questioning Tom Spink and Louis on their ideas of
where the various men may be sleeping&mdash;the point of which
always is: <i>Where is the second mate likely to be
sleeping</i>?</p>
<p>No later than yesterday afternoon did he give me most positive
proof of his obsession.&nbsp; It was four o&rsquo;clock, the
beginning of the first dog-watch, and he had just relieved
me.&nbsp; So careless have we grown, that we now stand in broad
daylight at the exposed break of the poop.&nbsp; Nobody shoots at
us, and, occasionally, over the top of the for&rsquo;ard-house,
Shorty sticks up his head and grins or makes clownish faces at
us.&nbsp; At such times Mr. Pike studies Shorty&rsquo;s features
through the telescope in an effort to find signs of
starvation.&nbsp; Yet he admits dolefully that Shorty is looking
fleshed-up.</p>
<p>But to return.&nbsp; Mr. Pike had just relieved me yesterday
afternoon, when the second mate climbed the forecastle-head and
sauntered to the very eyes of the <i>Elsinore</i>, where he stood
gazing overside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take a crack at &rsquo;m,&rdquo; Mr. Pike said.</p>
<p>It was a long shot, and I was taking slow and careful aim,
when he touched my arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>I lowered the little rifle and looked at him inquiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might hit him,&rdquo; he explained.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And I want him for myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Life is never what we expect it to be.&nbsp; All our voyage
from Baltimore south to the Horn and around the Horn has been
marked by violence and death.&nbsp; And now that it has
culminated in open mutiny there is no more violence, much less
death.&nbsp; We keep to ourselves aft, and the mutineers keep to
themselves for&rsquo;ard.&nbsp; There is no more harshness, no
more snarling and bellowing of commands; and in this fine weather
a general festival obtains.</p>
<p>Aft, Mr. Pike and Margaret alternate with phonograph and
piano; and for&rsquo;ard, although we cannot see them, a
full-fledged &ldquo;foo-foo&rdquo; band makes most of the day and
night hideous.&nbsp; A squealing accordion that Tom Spink says
was the property of Mike Cipriani is played by Guido Bombini, who
sets the pace and seems the leader of the foo-foo.&nbsp; There
are two broken-reeded harmonicas.&nbsp; Someone plays a
jew&rsquo;s-harp.&nbsp; Then there are home-made fifes and
whistles and drums, combs covered with paper, extemporized
triangles, and bones made from ribs of salt horse such as negro
minstrels use.</p>
<p>The whole crew seems to compose the band, and, like a lot of
monkey-folk rejoicing in rude rhythm, emphasizes the beat by
hammering kerosene cans, frying-pans, and all sorts of things
metallic or reverberant.&nbsp; Some genius has rigged a line to
the clapper of the ship&rsquo;s bell on the forecastle-head and
clangs it horribly in the big foo-foo crises, though Bombini can
be heard censuring him severely on occasion.&nbsp; And to cap it
all, the fog-horn machine pumps in at the oddest moments in
imitation of a big bass viol.</p>
<p>And this is mutiny on the high seas!&nbsp; Almost every hour
of my deck-watches I listen to this infernal din, and am maddened
into desire to join with Mr. Pike in a night attack and put these
rebellious and inharmonious slaves to work.</p>
<p>Yet they are not entirely inharmonious.&nbsp; Guido Bombini
has a respectable though untrained tenor voice, and has surprised
me by a variety of selections, not only from Verdi, but from
Wagner and Massenet.&nbsp; Bert Rhine and his crowd are full of
rag-time junk, and one phrase that has caught the fancy of all
hands, and which they roar out at all times, is:
&ldquo;<i>It&rsquo;s a bear</i>!&nbsp; <i>It&rsquo;s a
bear</i>!&nbsp; <i>It&rsquo;s a bear</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; This
morning Nancy, evidently very strongly urged, gave a doleful
rendering of <i>Flying Cloud</i>.&nbsp; Yes, and in the second
dog-watch last evening our three topaz-eyed dreamers sang some
folk-song strangely sweet and sad.</p>
<p>And this is mutiny!&nbsp; As I write I can scarcely believe
it.&nbsp; Yet I know Mr. Pike keeps the watch over my head.&nbsp;
I hear the shrill laughter of the steward and Louis over some
ancient Chinese joke.&nbsp; Wada and the sail-makers, in the
pantry, are, I know, talking Japanese politics.&nbsp; And from
across the cabin, along the narrow halls, I can hear Margaret
softly humming as she goes to bed.</p>
<p>But all doubts vanish at the stroke of eight bells, when I go
on deck to relieve Mr. Pike, who lingers a moment for a
&ldquo;gain,&rdquo; as he calls it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; he said confidentially, &ldquo;you and I
can clean out the whole gang.&nbsp; All we got to do is sneak
for&rsquo;ard and turn loose.&nbsp; As soon as we begin to shoot
up, half of &rsquo;em&rsquo;ll bolt aft&mdash;lobsters like
Nancy, an&rsquo; Sundry Buyers, an&rsquo; Jacobsen, an&rsquo;
Bob, an&rsquo; Shorty, an&rsquo; them three castaways, for
instance.&nbsp; An&rsquo; while they&rsquo;re doin&rsquo; that,
an&rsquo; our bunch on the poop is takin&rsquo; &rsquo;em in, you
an&rsquo; me can make a pretty big hole in them that&rsquo;s
left.&nbsp; What d&rsquo;ye say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I hesitated, thinking of Margaret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, say,&rdquo; he urged, &ldquo;once I jumped into
that fo&rsquo;c&rsquo;s&rsquo;le, at close range, I&rsquo;d start
right in, blim-blam-blim, fast as you could wink, nailing them
gangsters, an&rsquo; Bombini, an&rsquo; the Sheeny, an&rsquo;
Deacon, an&rsquo; the Cockney, an&rsquo; Mulligan Jacobs,
an&rsquo; . . . an&rsquo; . . . Waltham.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be mine,&rdquo; I smiled.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve only eight shots in your Colt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Pike considered a moment, and revised his list.&nbsp;
&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he agreed, &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll
have to let Jacobs go.&nbsp; What d&rsquo;ye say?&nbsp; Are you
game?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still I hesitated, but before I could speak he anticipated me
and returned to his fidelity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you can&rsquo;t do it, Mr. Pathurst.&nbsp; If by
any luck they got the both of us . . . No; we&rsquo;ll just stay
aft and sit tight until they&rsquo;re starved to it . . . But
where they get their tucker gets me.&nbsp; For&rsquo;ard
she&rsquo;s as bare as a bone, as any decent ship ought to be,
and yet look at &rsquo;em, rolling hog fat.&nbsp; And by rights
they ought to a-quit eatin&rsquo; a week ago.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XLIV</h2>
<p>Yes, it is certainly mutiny.&nbsp; Collecting water from the
leaders of the chart-house in a shower of rain this morning,
Buckwheat exposed himself, and a long, lucky revolver-shot from
for&rsquo;ard caught him in the shoulder.&nbsp; The bullet was
small-calibre and spent ere it reached him, so that he received
no more than a flesh-wound, though he carried on as if he were
dying until Mr. Pike hushed his noise by cuffing his ears.</p>
<p>I should not like to have Mr. Pike for my surgeon.&nbsp; He
probed for the bullet with his little finger, which was far too
big for the aperture; and with his little finger, while with his
other hand he threatened another ear-clout, he gouged out the
leaden pellet.&nbsp; Then he sent the boy below, where Margaret
took him in charge with antiseptics and dressings.</p>
<p>I see her so rarely that a half-hour alone with her these days
is an adventure.&nbsp; She is busy morning to night in keeping
her house in order.&nbsp; As I write this, through my open door I
can hear her laying the law down to the men in the
after-room.&nbsp; She has issued underclothes all around from the
slop-chest, and is ordering them to take a bath in the rain-water
just caught.&nbsp; And to make sure of their thoroughness in the
matter, she has told off Louis and the steward to supervise the
operation.&nbsp; Also, she has forbidden them smoking their pipes
in the after-room.&nbsp; And, to cap everything, they are to
scrub walls, ceiling, everything, and then start to-morrow
morning at painting.&nbsp; All of which serves to convince me
almost that mutiny does not obtain and that I have imagined
it.</p>
<p>But no.&nbsp; I hear Buckwheat blubbering and demanding how he
can take a bath in his wounded condition.&nbsp; I wait and listen
for Margaret&rsquo;s judgment.&nbsp; Nor am I disappointed.&nbsp;
Tom Spink and Henry are told off to the task, and the thorough
scrubbing of Buckwheat is assured.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>The mutineers are not starving.&nbsp; To-day they have been
fishing for albatrosses.&nbsp; A few minutes after they caught
the first one its carcase was flung overboard.&nbsp; Mr. Pike
studied it through his sea-glasses, and I heard him grit his
teeth when he made certain that it was not the mere feathers and
skin but the entire carcass.&nbsp; They had taken only its
wing-bones to make into pipe-stems.&nbsp; The inference was
obvious: <i>starving men would not throw meat away in such
fashion</i>.</p>
<p>But where do they get their food?&nbsp; It is a sea-mystery in
itself, although I might not so deem it were it not for Mr.
Pike.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think, and think, till my brain is all frazzled
out,&rdquo; he tells me; &ldquo;and yet I can&rsquo;t get a line
on it.&nbsp; I know every inch of space on the <i>Elsinore</i>,
and know there isn&rsquo;t an ounce of grub anywhere
for&rsquo;ard, and yet they eat!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve overhauled the
lazarette.&nbsp; As near as I can make it out, nothing is
missing.&nbsp; Then where do they get it?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what
I want to know.&nbsp; Where do they get it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I know that this morning he spent hours in the lazarette with
the steward and the cook, overhauling and checking off from the
lists of the Baltimore agents.&nbsp; And I know that they came up
out of the lazarette, the three of them, dripping with
perspiration and baffled.&nbsp; The steward has raised the
hypothesis that, first of all, there were extra stores left over
from the previous voyage, or from previous voyages, and, next,
that the stealing of these stores must have taken place during
the night-watches when it was Mr. Pike&rsquo;s turn below.</p>
<p>At any rate, the mate takes the food mystery almost as much to
heart as he takes the persistent and propinquitous existence of
Sidney Waltham.</p>
<p>I am coming to realize the meaning of watch-and-watch.&nbsp;
To begin with, I spend on deck twelve hours, and a fraction more,
of each twenty-four.&nbsp; A fair portion of the remaining twelve
is spent in eating, in dressing, and in undressing, and with
Margaret.&nbsp; As a result, I feel the need for more sleep than
I am getting.&nbsp; I scarcely read at all, now.&nbsp; The moment
my head touches the pillow I am asleep.&nbsp; Oh, I sleep like a
baby, eat like a navvy, and in years have not enjoyed such
physical well-being.&nbsp; I tried to read George Moore last
night, and was dreadfully bored.&nbsp; He may be a realist, but I
solemnly aver he does not know reality on that tight, little,
sheltered-life archipelago of his.&nbsp; If he could wind-jam
around the Horn just one voyage he would be twice the writer.</p>
<p>And Mr. Pike, for practically all of his sixty-nine years, has
stood his watch-and-watch, with many a spill-over of watches into
watches.&nbsp; And yet he is iron.&nbsp; In a struggle with him I
am confident that he would break me like so much straw.&nbsp; He
is truly a prodigy of a man, and, so far as to-day is concerned,
an anachronism.</p>
<p>The Faun is not dead, despite my unlucky bullet.&nbsp; Henry
insisted that he caught a glimpse of him yesterday.&nbsp; To-day
I saw him myself.&nbsp; He came to the corner of the
&rsquo;midship-house and gazed wistfully aft at the poop,
straining and eager to understand.&nbsp; In the same way I have
often seen Possum gaze at me.</p>
<p>It has just struck me that of our eight followers five are
Asiatic and only three are our own breed.&nbsp; Somehow it
reminds me of India and of Clive and Hastings.</p>
<p>And the fine weather continues, and we wonder how long a time
must elapse ere our mutineers eat up their mysterious food and
are starved back to work.</p>
<p>We are almost due west of Valparaiso and quite a bit less than
a thousand miles off the west coast of South America.&nbsp; The
light northerly breezes, varying from north-east to west, would,
according to Mr. Pike, work us in nicely for Valparaiso if only
we had sail on the <i>Elsinore</i>.&nbsp; As it is, sailless, she
drifts around and about and makes nowhere save for the slight
northerly drift each day.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Mr. Pike is beside himself.&nbsp; In the past two days he has
displayed increasing possession of himself by the one idea of
vengeance on the second mate.&nbsp; It is not the mutiny, irksome
as it is and helpless as it makes him; it is the presence of the
murderer of his old-time and admired skipper, Captain Somers.</p>
<p>The mate grins at the mutiny, calls it a snap, speaks
gleefully of how his wages are running up, and regrets that he is
not ashore, where he would be able to take a hand in gambling on
the reinsurance.&nbsp; But the sight of Sidney Waltham, calmly
gazing at sea and sky from the forecastle-head, or astride the
far end of the bowsprit and fishing for sharks, saddens
him.&nbsp; Yesterday, coming to relieve me, he borrowed my rifle
and turned loose the stream of tiny pellets on the second mate,
who coolly made his line secure ere he scrambled in-board.&nbsp;
Of course, it was only one chance in a hundred that Mr. Pike
might have hit him, but Sidney Waltham did not care to encourage
the chance.</p>
<p>And yet it is not like mutiny&mdash;not like the conventional
mutiny I absorbed as a boy, and which has become classic in the
literature of the sea.&nbsp; There is no hand-to-hand fighting,
no crash of cannon and flash of cutlass, no sailors drinking
grog, no lighted matches held over open powder-magazines.&nbsp;
Heavens!&mdash;there isn&rsquo;t a single cutlass nor a
powder-magazine on board.&nbsp; And as for grog, not a man has
had a drink since Baltimore.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Well, it is mutiny after all.&nbsp; I shall never doubt it
again.&nbsp; It may be nineteen-thirteen mutiny on a
coal-carrier, with feeblings and imbeciles and criminals for
mutineers; but at any rate mutiny it is, and at least in the
number of deaths it is reminiscent of the old days.&nbsp; For
things have happened since last I had opportunity to write up
this log.&nbsp; For that matter, I am now the keeper of the
<i>Elsinore&rsquo;s</i> official log as well, in which work
Margaret helps me.</p>
<p>And I might have known it would happen.&nbsp; At four
yesterday morning I relieved Mr. Pike.&nbsp; When in the darkness
I came up to him at the break of the poop, I had to speak to him
twice to make him aware of my presence.&nbsp; And then he merely
grunted acknowledgment in an absent sort of way.</p>
<p>The next moment he brightened up, and was himself save that he
was too bright.&nbsp; He was making an effort.&nbsp; I felt this,
but was quite unprepared for what followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be back in a minute,&rdquo; he said, as he
put his leg over the rail and lightly and swiftly lowered himself
down into the darkness.</p>
<p>There was nothing I could do.&nbsp; To cry out or to attempt
to reason with him would only have drawn the mutineers&rsquo;
attention.&nbsp; I heard his feet strike the deck beneath as he
let go.&nbsp; Immediately he started for&rsquo;ard.&nbsp; Little
enough precaution he took.&nbsp; I swear that clear to the
&rsquo;midship-house I heard the dragging age-lag of his
feet.&nbsp; Then that ceased, and that was all.</p>
<p>I repeat.&nbsp; That was all.&nbsp; Never a sound came from
for&rsquo;ard.&nbsp; I held my watch till daylight.&nbsp; I held
it till Margaret came on deck with her cheery &ldquo;What ho of
the night, brave mariner?&rdquo;&nbsp; I held the next watch
(which should have been the mate&rsquo;s) till midday, eating
both breakfast and lunch behind the sheltering jiggermast.&nbsp;
And I held all afternoon, and through both dog-watches, my dinner
served likewise on the deck.</p>
<p>And that was all.&nbsp; Nothing happened.&nbsp; The
galley-stove smoked three times, advertising the cooking of three
meals.&nbsp; Shorty made faces at me as usual across the rim of
the for&rsquo;ard-house.&nbsp; The Maltese Cockney caught an
albatross.&nbsp; There was some excitement when Tony the Greek
hooked a shark off the jib-boom, so big that half a dozen tailed
on to the line and failed to land it.&nbsp; But I caught no
glimpse of Mr. Pike nor of the renegade Sidney Waltham.</p>
<p>In short, it was a lazy, quiet day of sunshine and gentle
breeze.&nbsp; There was no inkling to what had happened to the
mate.&nbsp; Was he a prisoner?&nbsp; Was he already
overside?&nbsp; Why were there no shots?&nbsp; He had his big
automatic.&nbsp; It is inconceivable that he did not use it at
least once.&nbsp; Margaret and I discussed the affair till we
were well a-weary, but reached no conclusion.</p>
<p>She is a true daughter of the race.&nbsp; At the end of the
second dog-watch, armed with her father&rsquo;s revolver, she
insisted on standing the first watch of the night.&nbsp; I
compromised with the inevitable by having Wada make up my bed on
the deck in the shelter of the cabin skylight just for&rsquo;ard
of the jiggermast.&nbsp; Henry, the two sail-makers and the
steward, variously equipped with knives and clubs, were stationed
along the break of the poop.</p>
<p>And right here I wish to pass my first criticism on modern
mutiny.&nbsp; On ships like the <i>Elsinore</i> there are not
enough weapons to go around.&nbsp; The only firearms now aft are
Captain West&rsquo;s .38 Colt revolver, and my .22 automatic
Winchester.&nbsp; The old steward, with a penchant for hacking
and chopping, has his long knife and a butcher&rsquo;s
cleaver.&nbsp; Henry, in addition to his sheath-knife, has a
short bar of iron.&nbsp; Louis, despite a most sanguinary array
of butcher-knives and a big poker, pins his cook&rsquo;s faith on
hot water and sees to it that two kettles are always piping on
top the cabin stove.&nbsp; Buckwheat, who on account of his wound
is getting all night in for a couple of nights, cherishes a
hatchet.</p>
<p>The rest of our retainers have knives and clubs, although
Yatsuda, the first sail-maker, carries a hand-axe, and Uchino,
the second sail-maker, sleeping or waking, never parts from a
claw-hammer.&nbsp; Tom Spink has a harpoon.&nbsp; Wada, however,
is the genius.&nbsp; By means of the cabin stove he has made a
sharp pike-point of iron and fitted it to a pole.&nbsp; To-morrow
be intends to make more for the other men.</p>
<p>It is rather shuddery, however, to speculate on the terrible
assortment of cutting, gouging, jabbing and slashing weapons with
which the mutineers are able to equip themselves from the
carpenter&rsquo;s shop.&nbsp; If it ever comes to an assault on
the poop there will be a weird mess of wounds for the survivors
to dress.&nbsp; For that matter, master as I am of my little
rifle, no man could gain the poop in the day-time.&nbsp; Of
course, if rush they will, they will rush us in the night, when
my rifle will be worthless.&nbsp; Then it will be blow for blow,
hand-to-hand, and the strongest pates and arms will win.</p>
<p>But no.&nbsp; I have just bethought me.&nbsp; We shall be
ready for any night-rush.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll take a leaf out of
modern warfare, and show them not only that we are top-dog (a
favourite phrase of the mate), but <i>why</i> we are
top-dog.&nbsp; It is simple&mdash;night illumination.&nbsp; As I
write I work opt the idea&mdash;gasoline, balls of oakum, caps
and gunpowder from a few cartridges, Roman candles, and flares
blue, red, and green, shallow metal receptacles to carry the
explosive and inflammable stuff; and a trigger-like arrangement
by which, pulling on a string, the caps are exploded in the
gunpowder and fire set to the gasoline-soaked oakum and to the
flares and candles.&nbsp; It will be brain as well as brawn
against mere brawn.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>I have worked like a Trojan all day, and the idea is
realized.&nbsp; Margaret helped me out with suggestions, and Tom
Spink did the sailorizing.&nbsp; Over our head, from the
jiggermast, the steel stays that carry the three jigger-trysails
descend high above the break of the poop and across the main deck
to the mizzenmast.&nbsp; A light line has been thrown over each
stay, and been thrown repeatedly around so as to form an
unslipping knot.&nbsp; Tom Spink waited till dark, when he went
aloft and attached loose rings of stiff wire around the stays
below the knots.&nbsp; Also he bent on hoisting-gear and
connected permanent fastenings with the sliding rings.&nbsp; And
further, between rings and fastenings, is a slack of fifty feet
of light line.</p>
<p>This is the idea: after dark each night we shall hoist our
three metal wash-basins, loaded with inflammables, up to the
stays.&nbsp; The arrangement is such that at the first alarm of a
rush, by pulling a cord the trigger is pulled that ignites the
powder, and the very same pull operates a trip-device that lets
the rings slide down the steel stays.&nbsp; Of course, suspended
from the rings, are the illuminators, and when they have run down
the stays fifty feet the lines will automatically bring them to
rest.&nbsp; Then all the main deck between the poop and the
mizzen-mast will be flooded with light, while we shall be in
comparative darkness.</p>
<p>Of course each morning before daylight we shall lower all this
apparatus to the deck, so that the men for&rsquo;ard will not
guess what we have up our sleeve, or, rather, what we have up on
the trysail-stays.&nbsp; Even to-day the little of our gear that
has to be left standing aroused their curiosity.&nbsp; Head after
head showed over the edge of the for&rsquo;ard-house as they
peeped and peered and tried to make out what we were up to.&nbsp;
Why, I find myself almost looking forward to an attack in order
to see the device work.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XLV</h2>
<p>And what has happened to Mr. Pike remains a mystery.&nbsp; For
that matter, what has happened to the second mate?&nbsp; In the
past three days we have by our eyes taken the census of the
mutineers.&nbsp; Every man has been seen by us with the sole
exception of Mr. Mellaire, or Sidney Waltham, as I assume I must
correctly name him.&nbsp; He has not appeared&mdash;does not
appear; and we can only speculate and conjecture.</p>
<p>In the past three days various interesting things have taken
place.&nbsp; Margaret stands watch and watch with me, day and
night, the clock around; for there is no one of our retainers to
whom we can entrust the responsibility of a watch.&nbsp; Though
mutiny obtains and we are besieged in the high place, the weather
is so mild and there is so little call on our men that they have
grown careless and sleep aft of the chart-house when it is their
watch on deck.&nbsp; Nothing ever happens, and, like true
sailors, they wax fat and lazy.&nbsp; Even have I found Louis,
the steward, and Wada guilty of cat-napping.&nbsp; In fact, the
training-ship boy, Henry, is the only one who has never
lapsed.</p>
<p>Oh, yes, and I gave Tom Spink a thrashing yesterday.&nbsp;
Since the disappearance of the mate he had had little faith in
me, and had been showing vague signs of insolence and
insubordination.&nbsp; Both Margaret and I had noted it
independently.&nbsp; Day before yesterday we talked it over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a good sailor, but weak,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If we let him go on, he will infect the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, I&rsquo;ll take him in hand,&rdquo; I
announced valorously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will have to,&rdquo; she encouraged.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Be hard.&nbsp; Be hard.&nbsp; You must be hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those who sit in the high places must be hard, yet have I
discovered that it is hard to be hard.&nbsp; For instance, easy
enough was it to drop Steve Roberts as he was in the act of
shooting at me.&nbsp; Yet it is most difficult to be hard with a
chuckle-headed retainer like Tom Spink&mdash;especially when he
continually fails by a shade to give sufficient
provocation.&nbsp; For twenty-four hours after my talk with
Margaret I was on pins and needles to have it out with him, yet
rather than have had it out with him I should have preferred to
see the poop rushed by the gang from the other side.</p>
<p>Not in a day can the tyro learn to employ the snarling
immediacy of mastery of Mr. Pike, nor the reposeful, voiceless
mastery of a Captain West.&nbsp; Truly, the situation was
embarrassing.&nbsp; I was not trained in the handling of men, and
Tom Spink knew it in his chuckle-headed way.&nbsp; Also, in his
chuckle-headed way, he was dispirited by the loss of the
mate.&nbsp; Fearing the mate, nevertheless he had depended on the
mate to fetch him through with a whole skin, or at least
alive.&nbsp; On me he has no dependence.&nbsp; What chance had
the gentleman passenger and the captain&rsquo;s daughter against
the gang for&rsquo;ard?&nbsp; So he must have reasoned, and, so
reasoning, become despairing and desperate.</p>
<p>After Margaret had told me to be hard I watched Tom Spink with
an eagle eye, and he must have sensed my attitude, for he
carefully forebore from overstepping, while all the time he
palpitated just on the edge of overstepping.&nbsp; Yes, and it
was clear that Buckwheat was watching to learn the outcome of
this veiled refractoriness.&nbsp; For that matter, the situation
was not being missed by our keen-eyed Asiatics, and I know that I
caught Louis several times verging on the offence of offering me
advice.&nbsp; But he knew his place and managed to keep his
tongue between his teeth.</p>
<p>At last, yesterday, while I held the watch, Tom Spink was
guilty of spitting tobacco juice on the deck.</p>
<p>Now it must be understood that such an act is as grave an
offence of the sea as blasphemy is of the Church.</p>
<p>It was Margaret who came to where I was stationed by the
jiggermast and told me what had occurred; and it was she who took
my rifle and relieved me so that I could go aft.</p>
<p>There was the offensive spot, and there was Tom Spink, his
cheek bulging with a quid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, you, get a swab and mop that up,&rdquo; I
commanded in my harshest manner.</p>
<p>Tom Spink merely rolled his quid with his tongue and regarded
me with sneering thoughtfulness.&nbsp; I am sure he was no more
surprised than was I by the immediateness of what followed.&nbsp;
My fist went out like an arrow from a released bow, and Tom Spink
staggered back, tripped against the corner of the
tarpaulin-covered sounding-machine, and sprawled on the
deck.&nbsp; He tried to make a fight of it, but I followed him
up, giving him no chance to set himself or recover from the
surprise of my first onslaught.</p>
<p>Now it so happens that not since I was a boy have I struck a
person with my naked fist, and I candidly admit that I enjoyed
the trouncing I administered to poor Tom Spink.&nbsp; Yes, and in
the rapid play about the deck I caught a glimpse of
Margaret.&nbsp; She had stepped out of the shelter of the mast
and was looking on from the corner of the chart-house.&nbsp; Yes,
and more; she was looking on with a cool, measuring eye.</p>
<p>Oh, it was all very grotesque, to be sure.&nbsp; But then,
mutiny on the high seas in the year nineteen-thirteen is also
grotesque.&nbsp; No lists here between mailed knights for a
lady&rsquo;s favour, but merely the trouncing of a chuckle-head
for spitting on the deck of a coal-carrier.&nbsp; Nevertheless,
the fact that my lady looked on added zest to my enterprise, and,
doubtlessly, speed and weight to my blows, and at least half a
dozen additional clouts to the unlucky sailor.</p>
<p>Yes, man is strangely and wonderfully made.&nbsp; Now that I
coolly consider the matter, I realize that it was essentially the
same spirit with which I enjoyed beating up Tom Spink, that I
have in the past enjoyed contests of the mind in which I have
out-epigrammed clever opponents.&nbsp; In the one case, one
proves himself top-dog of the mind; in the other, top-dog of the
muscle.&nbsp; Whistler and Wilde were just as much intellectual
bullies as I was a physical bully yesterday morning when I
punched Tom Spink into lying down and staying down.</p>
<p>And my knuckles are sore and swollen.&nbsp; I cease writing
for a moment to look at them and to hope that they will not stay
permanently enlarged.</p>
<p>At any rate, Tom Spink took his disciplining and promised to
come in and be good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; I thundered at him, quite in Mr.
Pike&rsquo;s most bloodthirsty manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; he mumbled with bleeding lips.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, sir, I&rsquo;ll mop it up, sir.&nbsp; Yes,
sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could scarcely keep from laughing in his face, the whole
thing was so ludicrous; but I managed to look my haughtiest, and
sternest, and fiercest, while I superintended the
deck-cleansing.&nbsp; The funniest thing about the affair was
that I must have knocked Tom Spink&rsquo;s quid down his throat,
for he was gagging and hiccoughing all the time he mopped and
scrubbed.</p>
<p>The atmosphere aft has been wonderfully clear ever
since.&nbsp; Tom Spink obeys all orders on the jump, and
Buckwheat jumps with equal celerity.&nbsp; As for the five
Asiatics, I feel that they are stouter behind me now that I have
shown masterfulness.&nbsp; By punching a man&rsquo;s face I
verily believe I have doubled our united strength.&nbsp; And
there is no need to punch any of the rest.&nbsp; The Asiatics are
keen and willing.&nbsp; Henry is a true cadet of the breed,
Buckwheat will follow Tom Spink&rsquo;s lead, and Tom Spink, a
proper Anglo-Saxon peasant, will lead Buckwheat all the better by
virtue of the punching.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Two days have passed, and two noteworthy things have
happened.&nbsp; The men seem to be nearing the end of their
mysterious food supply, and we have had our first truce.</p>
<p>I have noted, through the glasses, that no more carcasses of
the mollyhawks they are now catching are thrown overboard.&nbsp;
This means that they have begun to eat the tough and unsavoury
creatures, although it does not mean, of course, that they have
entirely exhausted their other stores.</p>
<p>It was Margaret, her sailor&rsquo;s eye on the falling
barometer and on the &ldquo;making&rdquo; stuff adrift in the
sky, who called my attention to a coming blow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as the sea rises,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll have that loose main-yard and all the rest of
the top-hamper tumbling down on deck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it was that I raised the white flag for a parley.&nbsp;
Bert Rhine and Charles Davis came abaft the &rsquo;midship-house,
and, while we talked, many faces peered over the for&rsquo;ard
edge of the house and many forms slouched into view on the deck
on each side of the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, getting tired?&rdquo; was Bert Rhine&rsquo;s
insolent greeting.&nbsp; &ldquo;Anything we can do for
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there is,&rdquo; I answered sharply.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You can save your heads so that when you return to work
there will be enough of you left to do the work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are making threats&mdash;&rdquo; Charles Davis
began, but was silenced by a glare from the gangster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what is it?&rdquo; Bert Rhine demanded.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Cough it off your chest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s for your own good,&rdquo; was my
reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is coming on to blow, and all that
unfurled canvas aloft will bring the yards down on your
heads.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re safe here, aft.&nbsp; You are the ones
who will run risks, and it is up to you to hustle your crowd
aloft and make things fast and ship-shape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if we don&rsquo;t?&rdquo; the gangster sneered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;ll take your chances, that is
all,&rdquo; I answered carelessly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I just want to
call your attention to the fact that one of those steel yards,
end-on, will go through the roof of your forecastle as if it were
so much eggshell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bert Rhine looked to Charles Davis for verification, and the
latter nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk it over first,&rdquo; the gangster
announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll give you ten minutes,&rdquo; I
returned.&nbsp; &ldquo;If at the end of ten minutes you&rsquo;ve
not started taking in, it will be too late.&nbsp; I shall put a
bullet into any man who shows himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, we&rsquo;ll talk it over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they started to go back, I called:</p>
<p>&ldquo;One moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They stopped and turned about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you done to Mr. Pike?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>Even the impassive Bert Rhine could not quite conceal his
surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; what have you done with Mr. Mellaire!&rdquo;
he retorted.&nbsp; &ldquo;You tell us, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll tell
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am confident of the genuineness of his surprise.&nbsp;
Evidently the mutineers have been believing us guilty of the
disappearance of the second mate, just as we have been believing
them guilty of the disappearance of the first mate.&nbsp; The
more I dwell upon it the more it seems the proposition of the
Kilkenny cats, a case of mutual destruction on the part of the
two mates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another thing,&rdquo; I said quickly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Where do you get your food?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bert Rhine laughed one of his silent laughs; Charles Davis
assumed an expression of mysteriousness and superiority; and
Shorty, leaping into view from the corner of the house, danced a
jig of triumph.</p>
<p>I drew out my watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve ten
minutes in which to make a start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They turned and went for&rsquo;ard, and, before the ten
minutes were up, all hands were aloft and stowing canvas.&nbsp;
All this time the wind, out of the north-west, was breezing
up.&nbsp; The old familiar harp-chords of a rising gale were
strumming along the rigging, and the men, I verily believe from
lack of practice, were particularly slow at their work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be better if the upper-and-lower top-sails are
set so that we can heave to,&rdquo; Margaret suggested.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They will steady her and make it more comfortable for
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I seized the idea and improved upon it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better set the upper and lower topsails so that we can
handle the ship,&rdquo; I called to the gangster, who was
ordering the men about, quite like a mate, from the top of the
&rsquo;midship-house.</p>
<p>He considered the idea, and then gave the proper orders,
although it was the Maltese Cockney, with Nancy and Sundry Buyers
under him, who carried the orders out.</p>
<p>I ordered Tom Spink to the long-idle wheel, and gave him the
course, which was due east by the steering compass.&nbsp; This
put the wind on our port quarter, so that the <i>Elsinore</i>
began to move through the water before a fair breeze.&nbsp; And
due east, less than a thousand miles away, lay the coast of South
America and the port of Valparaiso.</p>
<p>Strange to say, none of our mutineers objected to this, and
after dark, as we tore along before a full-sized gale, I sent my
own men up on top the chart-house to take the gaskets off the
spanker.&nbsp; This was the only sail we could set and trim and
in every way control.&nbsp; It is true the mizzen-braces were
still rigged aft to the poop, according to Horn practice.&nbsp;
But, while we could thus trim the mizzen-yards, the sails
themselves, in setting or furling, were in the hands of the
for&rsquo;ard crowd.</p>
<p>Margaret, beside me in the darkness at the break of the poop,
put her hand in mine with a warm pressure, as both our tiny
watches swayed up the spanker and as both of us held our breaths
in an effort to feel the added draw in the
<i>Elsinore&rsquo;s</i> speed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never wanted to marry a sailor,&rdquo; she
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I thought I was safe in the hands of a
landsman like you.&nbsp; And yet here you are, with all the stuff
of the sea in you, running down your easting for port.&nbsp; Next
thing, I suppose, I&rsquo;ll see you out with a sextant, shooting
the sun or making star-observations.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XLVI</h2>
<p>Four more days have passed; the gale has blown itself out; we
are not more than three hundred and fifty miles off Valparaiso;
and the <i>Elsinore</i>, this time due to me and my own
stubbornness, is rolling in the wind and heading nowhere in a
light breeze at the rate of nothing but driftage per hour.</p>
<p>In the height of the gusts, in the three days and nights of
the gale, we logged as much as eight, and even nine, knots.&nbsp;
What bothered me was the acquiescence of the mutineers in my
programme.&nbsp; They were sensible enough in the simple matter
of geography to know what I was doing.&nbsp; They had control of
the sails, and yet they permitted me to run for the South
American coast.</p>
<p>More than that, as the gale eased on the morning of the third
day, they actually went aloft, set top-gallant-sails, royals, and
skysails, and trimmed the yards to the quartering breeze.&nbsp;
This was too much for the Saxon streak in me, whereupon I wore
the <i>Elsinore</i> about before the wind, fetched her up upon
it, and lashed the wheel.&nbsp; Margaret and I are agreed in the
hypothesis that their plan is to get inshore until land is
sighted, at which time they will desert in the boats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we don&rsquo;t want them to desert,&rdquo; she
proclaims with flashing eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are bound for
Seattle.&nbsp; They must return to duty.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve got
to, soon, for they are beginning to starve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t a navigator aft,&rdquo; I oppose.</p>
<p>Promptly she withers me with her scorn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, a master of books, by all the sea-blood in your
body should be able to pick up the theoretics of navigation while
I snap my fingers.&nbsp; Furthermore, remember that I can supply
the seamanship.&nbsp; Why, any squarehead peasant, in a six
months&rsquo; cramming course at any seaport navigation school,
can pass the examiners for his navigator&rsquo;s papers.&nbsp;
That means six hours for you.&nbsp; And less.&nbsp; If you
can&rsquo;t, after an hour&rsquo;s reading and an hour&rsquo;s
practice with the sextant, take a latitude observation and work
it out, I&rsquo;ll do it for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean, from the little I know, that I know I can learn
to know a meridian sight and the working out of it.&nbsp; I mean
that I can learn to know inside of two hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Strange to say, the gale, after easing to a mild breeze,
recrudesced in a sort of after-clap.&nbsp; With sails untrimmed
and flapping, the consequent smashing, crashing, and rending of
our gear can be imagined.&nbsp; It brought out in alarm every man
for&rsquo;ard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trim the yards!&rdquo; I yelled at Bert Rhine, who,
backed for counsel by Charles Davis and the Maltese Cockney,
actually came directly beneath me on the main deck in order to
hear above the commotion aloft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep a-runnin, an&rsquo; you won&rsquo;t have to
trim,&rdquo; the gangster shouted up to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want to make land, eh?&rdquo; I girded down at
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Getting hungry, eh?&nbsp; Well, you won&rsquo;t
make land or anything else in a thousand years once you get all
your top-hamper piled down on deck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have forgotten to state that this occurred at midday
yesterday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you goin&rsquo; to do if we trim?&rdquo;
Charles Davis broke in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run off shore,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;and get your
gang out in deep sea where it will be starved back to
duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll furl, an&rsquo; let you heave to,&rdquo;
the gangster proposed.</p>
<p>I shook my head and held up my rifle.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to go aloft to do it, and the first man
that gets into the shrouds will get this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she can go to hell for all we care,&rdquo; he
said, with emphatic conclusiveness.</p>
<p>And just then the fore-topgallant-yard carried
away&mdash;luckily as the bow was down-pitched into a trough of
sea-and when the slow, confused, and tangled descent was
accomplished the big stick lay across the wreck of both bulwarks
and of that portion of the bridge between the foremast and the
forecastle head.</p>
<p>Bert Rhine heard, but could not see, the damage wrought.&nbsp;
He looked up at me challengingly, and sneered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want some more to come down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It could not have happened more apropos.&nbsp; The port-brace,
and immediately afterwards the starboard-brace, of the
crojack-yard&mdash;carried away.&nbsp; This was the big, lowest
spar on the mizzen, and as the huge thing of steel swung wildly
back and forth the gangster and his followers turned and crouched
as they looked up to see.&nbsp; Next, the gooseneck of the truss,
on which it pivoted, smashed away.&nbsp; Immediately the lifts
and lower-topsail sheets parted, and with a fore-and-aft pitch of
the ship the spar up-ended and crashed to the deck upon Number
Three hatch, destroying that section of the bridge in its
fall.</p>
<p>All this was new to the gangster&mdash;as it was to
me&mdash;but Charles Davis and the Maltese Cockney thoroughly
apprehended the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand out from under!&rdquo; I yelled sardonically; and
the three of them cowered and shrank away as their eyes sought
aloft for what new spar was thundering down upon them.</p>
<p>The lower-topsail, its sheets parted by the fall of the
crojack-yard, was tearing out of the bolt-ropes and ribboning
away to leeward and making such an uproar that they might well
expect its yard to carry away.&nbsp; Since this wreckage of our
beautiful gear was all new to me, I was quite prepared to see the
thing happen.</p>
<p>The gangster-leader, no sailor, but, after months at sea,
intelligent enough and nervously strong enough to appreciate the
danger, turned his head and looked up at me.&nbsp; And I will do
him the credit to say that he took his time while all our world
of gear aloft seemed smashing to destruction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;ll trim yards,&rdquo; he
capitulated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better get the skysails and royals off,&rdquo; Margaret
said in my ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While you&rsquo;re about it, get in the skysails and
royals!&rdquo; I shouted down.&nbsp; &ldquo;And make a decent job
of the gasketing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both Charles Davis and the Maltese Cockney advertised their
relief in their faces as they heard my words, and, at a nod from
the gangster, they started for&rsquo;ard on the run to put the
orders into effect.</p>
<p>Never, in the whole voyage, did our crew spring to it in more
lively fashion.&nbsp; And lively fashion was needed to save our
gear.&nbsp; As it was, they cut away the remnants of the
mizzen-lower-topsail with their sheath-knives, and they loosed
the main-skysail out of its bolt-ropes.</p>
<p>The first infraction of our agreement was on the
main-lower-topsail.&nbsp; This they attempted to furl.&nbsp; The
carrying away of the crojack and the blowing away of the
mizzen-lower-topsail gave me freedom to see and aim, and when the
tiny messengers from my rifle began to spat through the canvas
and to spat against the steel of the yard, the men strung along
it desisted from passing the gaskets.&nbsp; I waved my will to
Bert Rhine, who acknowledged me and ordered the sail set again
and the yard trimmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the use of running off-shore?&rdquo; I said to
Margaret, when the kites were snugged down and all yards trimmed
on the wind.&nbsp; &ldquo;Three hundred and fifty miles off the
land is as good as thirty-five hundred so far as starvation is
concerned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, instead of making speed through the water toward deep sea,
I hove the <i>Elsinore</i> to on the starboard tack with no more
than leeway driftage to the west and south.</p>
<p>But our gallant mutineers had their will of us that very
night.&nbsp; In the darkness we could hear the work aloft going
on as yards were run down, sheets let go, and sails dewed up and
gasketed.&nbsp; I did try a few random shots, and all my reward
was to hear the whine and creak of ropes through sheaves and to
receive an equally random fire of revolver-shots.</p>
<p>It is a most curious situation.&nbsp; We of the high place are
masters of the steering of the <i>Elsinore</i>, while those
for&rsquo;ard are masters of the motor power.&nbsp; The only sail
that is wholly ours is the spanker.&nbsp; They control
absolutely&mdash;sheets, halyards, clewlines, buntlines, braces,
and down-hauls&mdash;every sail on the fore and main.&nbsp; We
control the braces on the mizzen, although they control the
canvas on the mizzen.&nbsp; For that matter, Margaret and I fail
to comprehend why they do not go aloft any dark night and sever
the mizzen-braces at the yard-ends.&nbsp; All that prevents this,
we are decided, is laziness.&nbsp; For if they did sever the
braces that lead aft into our hands, they would be compelled to
rig new braces for&rsquo;ard in some fashion, else, in the
rolling, would the mizzenmast be stripped of every spar.</p>
<p>And still the mutiny we are enduring is ridiculous and
grotesque.&nbsp; There was never a mutiny like it.&nbsp; It
violates all standards and precedents.&nbsp; In the old classic
mutinies, long ere this, attacking like tigers, the seamen should
have swarmed over the poop and killed most of us or been most of
them killed.</p>
<p>Wherefore I sneer at our gallant mutineers, and recommend
trained nurses for them, quite in the manner of Mr. Pike.&nbsp;
But Margaret shakes her head and insists that human nature is
human nature, and that under similar circumstances human nature
will express itself similarly.&nbsp; In short, she points to the
number of deaths that have already occurred, and declares that on
some dark night, sooner or later, whenever the pinch of hunger
sufficiently sharpens, we shall see our rascals storming aft.</p>
<p>And in the meantime, except for the tenseness of it, and for
the incessant watchfulness which Margaret and I alone maintain,
it is more like a mild adventure, more like a page out of some
book of romance which ends happily.</p>
<p>It is surely romance, watch and watch for a man and a woman
who love, to relieve each other&rsquo;s watches.&nbsp; Each such
relief is a love passage and unforgettable.&nbsp; Never was there
wooing like it&mdash;the muttered surmises of wind and weather,
the whispered councils, the kissed commands in palms of hands,
the dared contacts of the dark.</p>
<p>Oh, truly, I have often, since this voyage began, told the
books to go hang.&nbsp; And yet the books are at the back of the
race-life of me.&nbsp; I am what I am out of ten thousand
generations of my kind.&nbsp; Of that there is no
discussion.&nbsp; And yet my midnight philosophy stands the test
of my breed.&nbsp; I must have selected my books out of the ten
thousand generations that compose me.&nbsp; I have killed a
man&mdash;Steve Roberts.&nbsp; As a perishing blond without an
alphabet I should have done this unwaveringly.&nbsp; As a
perishing blond with an alphabet, plus the contents in my brain
of the philosophizing of all philosophers, I have killed this
same man with the same unwaveringness.&nbsp; Culture has not
emasculated me.&nbsp; I am quite unaffected.&nbsp; It was in the
day&rsquo;s work, and my kind have always been day-workers, doing
the day&rsquo;s work, whatever it might be, in high adventure or
dull ploddingness, and always doing it.</p>
<p>Never would I ask to set back the dial of time or event.&nbsp;
I would kill Steve Roberts again, under the same circumstances,
as a matter of course.&nbsp; When I say I am unaffected by this
happening I do not quite mean it.&nbsp; I am affected.&nbsp; I am
aware that the spirit of me is informed with a sober elation of
efficiency.&nbsp; I have done something that had to be done, as
any man will do what has to be done in the course of the
day&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>Yes, I am a perishing blond, and a man, and I sit in the high
place and bend the stupid ones to my will; and I am a lover,
loving a royal woman of my own perishing breed, and together we
occupy, and shall occupy, the high place of government and
command until our kind perish from the earth.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XLVII</h2>
<p>Margaret was right.&nbsp; The mutiny is not violating
standards and precedents.&nbsp; We have had our hands full for
days and nights.&nbsp; Ditman Olansen, the crank-eyed Berserker,
has been killed by Wada, and the training-ship boy, the one lone
cadet of our breed, has gone overside with the regulation sack of
coal at his feet.&nbsp; The poop has been rushed.&nbsp; My
illuminating invention has proved a success.&nbsp; The men are
getting hungry, and we still sit in command in the high
place.</p>
<p>First of all the attack on the poop, two nights ago, in
Margaret&rsquo;s watch.&nbsp; No; first, I have made another
invention.&nbsp; Assisted by the old steward, who knows, as a
Chinese ought, a deal about fireworks, and getting my materials
from our signal rockets and Roman candles, I manufactured half a
dozen bombs.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t really think they are very
deadly, and I know our extemporized fuses are slower than our
voyage is at the present time; but nevertheless the bombs have
served the purpose, as you shall see.</p>
<p>And now to the attempt to rush the poop.&nbsp; It was in
Margaret&rsquo;s watch, from midnight till four in the morning,
when the attack was made.&nbsp; Sleeping on the deck by the cabin
skylight, I was very close to her when her revolver went off, and
continued to go off.</p>
<p>My first spring was to the tripping-lines on my
illuminators.&nbsp; The igniting and releasing devices worked
cleverly.&nbsp; I pulled two of the tripping-lines, and two of
the contraptions exploded into light and noise and at the same
time ran automatically down the jigger-trysail-stays, and
automatically fetched up at the ends of their lines.&nbsp; The
illumination was instantaneous and gorgeous.&nbsp; Henry, the two
sail-makers, and the steward&mdash;at least three of them
awakened from sound sleep, I am sure&mdash;ran to join us along
the break of the poop.&nbsp; All the advantage lay with us, for
we were in the dark, while our foes were outlined against the
light behind them.</p>
<p>But such light!&nbsp; The powder crackled, fizzed, and
spluttered and spilled out the excess of gasolene from the
flaming oakum balls so that streams of fire dripped down on the
main deck beneath.&nbsp; And the stuff of the signal-flares
dripped red light and blue and green.</p>
<p>There was not much of a fight, for the mutineers were shocked
by our fireworks.&nbsp; Margaret fired her revolver haphazardly,
while I held my rifle for any that gained the poop.&nbsp; But the
attack faded away as quickly as it had come.&nbsp; I did see
Margaret overshoot some man, scaling the poop from the port-rail,
and the next moment I saw Wada, charging like a buffalo, jab him
in the chest with the spear he had made and thrust the boarder
back and down.</p>
<p>That was all.&nbsp; The rest retreated for&rsquo;ard on the
dead run, while the three trysails, furled at the foot of the
stays next to the mizzen and set on fire by the dripping
gasolene, went up in flame and burned entirely away and out
without setting the rest of the ship on fire.&nbsp; That is one
of the virtues of a ship steel-masted and steel-stayed.</p>
<p>And on the deck beneath us, crumpled, twisted, face hidden so
that we could not identify him, lay the man whom Wada had
speared.</p>
<p>And now I come to a phase of adventure that is new to
me.&nbsp; I have never found it in the books.&nbsp; In short, it
is carelessness coupled with laziness, or vice versa.&nbsp; I had
used two of my illuminators.&nbsp; Only one remained.&nbsp; An
hour later, convinced of the movement aft of men along the deck,
I let go the third and last and with its brightness sent them
scurrying for&rsquo;ard.&nbsp; Whether they were attacking the
poop tentatively to learn whether or not I had exhausted my
illuminators, or whether or not they were trying to rescue Ditman
Olansen, we shall never know.&nbsp; The point is: they did come
aft; they were compelled to retreat by my illuminator; and it was
my last illuminator.&nbsp; And yet I did not start in, there and
then, to manufacture fresh ones.&nbsp; This was
carelessness.&nbsp; It was laziness.&nbsp; And I hazarded our
lives, perhaps, if you please, on a psychological guess that I
had convinced our mutineers that we had an inexhaustible stock of
illuminators in reserve.</p>
<p>The rest of Margaret&rsquo;s watch, which I shared with her,
was undisturbed.&nbsp; At four I insisted that she go below and
turn in, but she compromised by taking my own bed behind the
skylight.</p>
<p>At break of day I was able to make out the body, still lying
as last I had seen it.&nbsp; At seven o&rsquo;clock, before
breakfast, and while Margaret still slept, I sent the two boys,
Henry and Buckwheat, down to the body.&nbsp; I stood above them,
at the rail, rifle in hand and ready.&nbsp; But from
for&rsquo;ard came no signs of life; and the lads, between them,
rolled the crank-eyed Norwegian over so that we could recognize
him, carried him to the rail, and shoved him stiffly across and
into the sea.&nbsp; Wada&rsquo;s spear-thrust had gone clear
through him.</p>
<p>But before twenty-four hours were up the mutineers evened the
score handsomely.&nbsp; They more than evened it, for we are so
few that we cannot so well afford the loss of one as they
can.&nbsp; To begin with&mdash;and a thing I had anticipated and
for which I had prepared my bombs&mdash;while Margaret and I ate
a deck-breakfast in the shelter of the jiggermast a number of the
men sneaked aft and got under the overhang of the poop.&nbsp;
Buckwheat saw them coming and yelled the alarm, but it was too
late.&nbsp; There was no direct way to get them out.&nbsp; The
moment I put my head over the rail to fire at them, I knew they
would fire up at me with all the advantage in their favour.&nbsp;
They were hidden.&nbsp; I had to expose myself.</p>
<p>Two steel doors, tight-fastened and caulked against the Cape
Horn seas, opened under the overhang of the poop from the cabin
on to the main deck.&nbsp; These doors the men proceeded to
attack with sledge-hammers, while the rest of the gang, sheltered
by the &rsquo;midship-house, showed that it stood ready for the
rush when the doors were battered down.</p>
<p>Inside, the steward guarded one door with his hacking knife,
while with his spear Wada guarded the other door.&nbsp; Nor,
while I had dispatched them to this duty, was I idle.&nbsp;
Behind the jiggermast I lighted the fuse of one of my
extemporized bombs.&nbsp; When it was sputtering nicely I ran
across the poop to the break and dropped the bomb to the main
deck beneath, at the same time making an effort to toss it in
under the overhang where the men battered at the port-door.&nbsp;
But this effort was distracted and made futile by a popping of
several revolver shots from the gangways amidships.&nbsp; One
<i>is</i> jumpy when soft-nosed bullets putt-putt around
him.&nbsp; As a result, the bomb rolled about on the open
deck.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the illuminators had earned the respect of the
mutineers for my fireworks.&nbsp; The sputtering and fizzling of
the fuse were too much for them, and from under the poop they ran
for&rsquo;ard like so many scuttling rabbits.&nbsp; I know I
could have got a couple with my rifle had I not been occupied
with lighting the fuse of a second bomb.&nbsp; Margaret managed
three wild shots with her revolver, and the poop was immediately
peppered by a scattering revolver fire from for&rsquo;ard.</p>
<p>Being provident (and lazy, for I have learned that it takes
time and labour to manufacture home-made bombs), I pinched off
the live end of the fuse in my hand.&nbsp; But the fuse of the
first bomb, rolling about on the main deck, merely fizzled on;
and as I waited I resolved to shorten my remaining fuses.&nbsp;
Any of the men who fled, had he had the courage, could have
pinched off the fuse, or tossed the bomb overboard, or, better
yet, he could have tossed it up amongst us on the poop.</p>
<p>It took fully five minutes for that blessed fuse to burn its
slow length, and when the bomb did go off it was a sad
disappointment.&nbsp; I swear it could have been sat upon with
nothing more than a jar to one&rsquo;s nerves.&nbsp; And yet, in
so far as the intimidation goes, it did its work.&nbsp; The men
have not since ventured under the overhang of the poop.</p>
<p>That the mutineers were getting short of food was
patent.&nbsp; The <i>Elsinore</i>, sailless, drifted about that
morning, the sport of wind and wave; and the gang put many lines
overboard for the catching of mollyhawks and albatrosses.&nbsp;
Oh, I worried the hungry fishers with my rifle.&nbsp; No man
could show himself for&rsquo;ard without having a bullet whop
against the iron-work perilously near him.&nbsp; And still they
caught birds&mdash;not, however, without danger to themselves,
and not without numerous losses of birds due to my rifle.</p>
<p>Their procedure was to toss their hooks and bait over the rail
from shelter and slowly to pay the lines out as the slight
windage of the <i>Elsinore&rsquo;s</i> hull, spars, and rigging
drifted her through the water.&nbsp; When a bird was hooked they
hauled in the line, still from shelter, till it was
alongside.&nbsp; This was the ticklish moment.&nbsp; The hook,
merely a hollow and acute-angled triangle of sheet-copper
floating on a piece of board at the end of the line, held the
bird by pinching its curved beak into the acute angle.&nbsp; The
moment the line slacked the bird was released.&nbsp; So, when
alongside, this was the problem: to lift the bird out of the
water, straight up the side of the ship, without once jamming and
easing and slacking.&nbsp; When they tried to do this from
shelter invariably they lost the bird.</p>
<p>They worked out a method.&nbsp; When the bird was alongside
the several men with revolvers turned loose on me, while one man,
overhauling and keeping the line taut, leaped to the rail and
quickly hove the bird up and over and inboard.&nbsp; I know this
long-distance revolver fire seriously bothered me.&nbsp; One
cannot help jumping when death, in the form of a piece of flying
lead, hits the rail beside him, or the mast over his head, or
whines away in a ricochet from the steel shrouds.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, I managed with my rifle to bother the exposed men
on the rail to the extent that they lost one hooked bird out of
two.&nbsp; And twenty-six men require a quantity of albatrosses
and mollyhawks every twenty-four hours, while they can fish only
in the daylight.</p>
<p>As the day wore along I improved on my obstructive
tactics.&nbsp; When the <i>Elsinore</i> was up in the eye of the
wind, and making sternway, I found that by putting the wheel
sharply over, one way or the other, I could swing her bow
off.&nbsp; Then, when she had paid off till the wind was abeam,
by reversing the wheel hard across to the opposite hard-over I
could take advantage of her momentum away from the wind and work
her off squarely before it.&nbsp; This made all the wood-floated
triangles of bird-snares tow aft along her sides.</p>
<p>The first time I was ready for them.&nbsp; With hooks and
sinkers on our own lines aft, we tossed out, grappled, captured,
and broke off nine of their lines.&nbsp; But the next time, so
slow is the movement of so large a ship, the mutineers hauled all
their lines safely inboard ere they towed aft within striking
distance of my grapnels.</p>
<p>Still I improved.&nbsp; As long as I kept the <i>Elsinore</i>
before the wind they could not fish.&nbsp; I experimented.&nbsp;
Once before it, by means of a winged-out spanker coupled with
patient and careful steering, I could keep her before it.&nbsp;
This I did, hour by hour one of my men relieving another at the
wheel.&nbsp; As a result all fishing ceased.</p>
<p>Margaret was holding the first dog-watch, four to six.&nbsp;
Henry was at the wheel steering.&nbsp; Wada and Louis were below
cooking the evening meal over the big coal-stove and the
oil-burners.&nbsp; I had just come up from below and was standing
beside the sounding-machine, not half a dozen feet from Henry at
the wheel.&nbsp; Some obscure sound from the ventilator must have
attracted me, for I was gazing at it when the thing happened.</p>
<p>But first, the ventilator.&nbsp; This is a steel shaft that
leads up from the coal-carrying bowels of the ship beneath the
lazarette and that wins to the outside-world via the after-wall
of the chart-house.&nbsp; In fact, it occupies the hollow inside
of the double walls of the afterwall of the chart-house.&nbsp;
Its opening, at the height of a man&rsquo;s head, is screened
with iron bars so closely set that no mature-bodied rat can
squeeze between.&nbsp; Also, this opening commands the wheel,
which is a scant fifteen feet away and directly across the
booby-hatch.&nbsp; Some mutineer, crawling along the space
between the coal and the deck of the lower hold, had climbed the
ventilator shaft and was able to take aim through the slits
between the bars.</p>
<p>Practically simultaneously, I saw the out-rush of smoke and
heard the report.&nbsp; I heard a grunt from Henry, and, turning
my head, saw him cling to the spokes and turn the wheel half a
revolution as he sank to the deck.&nbsp; It must have been a
lucky shot.&nbsp; The boy was perforated through the heart or
very near to the heart&mdash;we have no time for post-mortems on
the <i>Elsinore</i>.</p>
<p>Tom Spink and the second sail-maker, Uchino, sprang to
Henry&rsquo;s side.&nbsp; The revolver continued to go off
through the ventilator slits, and the bullets thudded into the
front of the half wheel-house all about them.&nbsp; Fortunately
they were not hit, and they immediately scrambled out of
range.&nbsp; The boy quivered for the space of a few seconds, and
ceased to move; and one more cadet of the perishing breed
perished as he did his day&rsquo;s work at the wheel of the
<i>Elsinore</i> off the west coast of South America, bound from
Baltimore to Seattle with a cargo of coal.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XLVIII</h2>
<p>The situation is hopelessly grotesque.&nbsp; We in the high
place command the food of the <i>Elsinore</i>, but the mutineers
have captured her steering-gear.&nbsp; That is to say, they have
captured it without coming into possession of it.&nbsp; They
cannot steer, neither can we.&nbsp; The poop, which is the high
place, is ours.&nbsp; The wheel is on the poop, yet we cannot
touch the wheel.&nbsp; From that slitted opening in the
ventilator-shaft they are able to shoot down any man who
approaches the wheel.&nbsp; And with that steel wall of the
chart-house as a shield they laugh at us as from a conning
tower.</p>
<p>I have a plan, but it is not worth while putting into
execution unless its need becomes imperative.&nbsp; In the
darkness of night it would be an easy trick to disconnect the
steering-gear from the short tiller on the rudder-head, and then,
by re-rigging the preventer tackles, steer from both sides of the
poop well enough for&rsquo;ard to be out of the range of the
ventilator.</p>
<p>In the meantime, in this fine weather, the <i>Elsinore</i>
drifts as she lists, or as the windage of her lists and the
sea-movement of waves lists.&nbsp; And she can well drift.&nbsp;
Let the mutineers starve.&nbsp; They can best be brought to their
senses through their stomachs.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>And what are wits for, if not for use?&nbsp; I am breaking the
men&rsquo;s hungry hearts.&nbsp; It is great fun in its
way.&nbsp; The mollyhawks and albatrosses, after their fashion,
have followed the <i>Elsinore</i> up out of their own
latitudes.&nbsp; This means that there are only so many of them
and that their numbers are not recruited.&nbsp; Syllogism: major
premise, a definite and limited amount of bird-meat; minor
premise, the only food the mutineers now have is bird-meat;
conclusion, destroy the available food and the mutineers will be
compelled to come back to duty.</p>
<p>I have acted on this bit of logic.&nbsp; I began
experimentally by tossing small chunks of fat pork and crusts of
stale bread overside.&nbsp; When the birds descended for the
feast I shot them.&nbsp; Every carcass thus left floating on the
surface of the sea was so much less meat for the mutineers.</p>
<p>But I bettered the method.&nbsp; Yesterday I overhauled the
medicine-chest, and I dosed my chunks of fat pork and bread with
the contents of every bottle that bore a label of skull and
cross-bones.&nbsp; I even added rough-on-rats to the deadliness
of the mixture&mdash;this on the suggestion of the steward.</p>
<p>And to-day, behold, there is no bird left in the sky.&nbsp;
True, while I played my game yesterday, the mutineers hooked a
few of the birds; but now the rest are gone, and that is bound to
be the last food for the men for&rsquo;ard until they resume
duty.</p>
<p>Yes; it is grotesque.&nbsp; It is a boy&rsquo;s game.&nbsp; It
reads like Midshipman Easy, like Frank Mildmay, like Frank Reade,
Jr.; and yet, i&rsquo; faith, life and death&rsquo;s in the
issue.&nbsp; I have just gone over the toll of our dead since the
voyage began.</p>
<p>First, was Christian Jespersen, killed by O&rsquo;Sullivan
when that maniac aspired to throw overboard Andy Fay&rsquo;s
sea-boots; then O&rsquo;Sullivan, because he interfered with
Charles Davis&rsquo; sleep, brained by that worthy with a steel
marlin-spike; next Petro Marinkovich, just ere we began the
passage of the Horn, murdered undoubtedly by the gangster clique,
his life cut out of him with knives, his carcass left lying on
deck to be found by us and be buried by us; and the Samurai,
Captain West, a sudden though not a violent death, albeit
occurring in the midst of all elemental violence as Mr. Pike
clawed the <i>Elsinore</i> off the lee-shore of the Horn; and
Boney the Splinter, following, washed overboard to drown as we
cleared the sea-gashing rock-tooth where the southern tip of the
continent bit into the storm-wrath of the Antarctic; and the
big-footed, clumsy youth of a Finnish carpenter, hove overside as
a Jonah by his fellows who believed that Finns control the winds;
and Mike Cipriani and Bill Quigley, Rome and Ireland, shot down
on the poop and flung overboard alive by Mr. Pike, still alive
and clinging to the log-line, cut adrift by the steward to be
eaten alive by great-beaked albatrosses, mollyhawks, and
sooty-plumaged Cape hens; Steve Roberts, one-time cowboy, shot by
me as he tried to shoot me; Herman Lunkenheimer, his throat cut
before all of us by the hound Bombini as Kid Twist stretched the
throat taut from behind; the two mates, Mr. Pike and Mr.
Mellaire, mutually destroying each other in what must have been
an unwitnessed epic combat; Ditman Olansen, speared by Wada as he
charged Berserk at the head of the mutineers in the attempt to
rush the poop; and last, Henry, the cadet of the perishing house,
shot at the wheel, from the ventilator-shaft, in the course of
his day&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>No; as I contemplate this roll-call of the dead which I have
just made I see that we are not playing a boy&rsquo;s game.&nbsp;
Why, we have lost a third of us, and the bloodiest battles of
history have rarely achieved such a percentage of
mortality.&nbsp; Fourteen of us have gone overside, and who can
tell the end?</p>
<p>Nevertheless, here we are, masters of matter, adventurers in
the micro-organic, planet-weighers, sun-analysers, star-rovers,
god-dreamers, equipped with the human wisdom of all the ages, and
yet, quoting Mr. Pike, to come down to brass tacks, we are a lot
of primitive beasts, fighting bestially, slaying bestially,
pursuing bestially food and water, air for our lungs, a dry space
above the deep, and carcasses skin-covered and intact.&nbsp; And
over this menagerie of beasts Margaret and I, with our Asiatics
under us, rule top-dog.&nbsp; We are all dogs&mdash;there is no
getting away from it.&nbsp; And we, the fair-pigmented ones, by
the seed of our ancestry rulers in the high place, shall remain
top-dog over the rest of the dogs.&nbsp; Oh, there is material in
plenty for the cogitation of any philosopher on a windjammer in
mutiny in this Year of our Lord 1913.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Henry was the fourteenth of us to go overside into the dark
and salty disintegration of the sea.&nbsp; And in one day he has
been well avenged; for two of the mutineers have followed
him.&nbsp; The steward called my attention to what was taking
place.&nbsp; He touched my arm half beyond his servant&rsquo;s
self, as he gloated for&rsquo;ard at the men heaving two corpses
overside.&nbsp; Weighted with coal, they sank immediately, so
that we could not identify them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have been fighting,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
is good that they should fight among themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the old Chinese merely grinned and shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think they have been fighting?&rdquo; I
queried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No fight.&nbsp; They eat&rsquo;m mollyhawk and
albatross; mollyhawk and albatross eat&rsquo;m fat pork; two men
he die, plenty men much sick, you bet, damn to hell me very much
glad.&nbsp; I savve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I think he was right.&nbsp; While I was busy baiting the
sea-birds the mutineers were catching them, and of a surety they
must have caught some that had eaten of my various poisons.</p>
<p>The two poisoned ones went over the side yesterday.&nbsp;
Since then we have taken the census.&nbsp; Two men only have not
appeared, and they are Bob, the fat and overgrown feebling youth,
and, of all creatures, the Faun.&nbsp; It seems my fate that I
had to destroy the Faun&mdash;the poor, tortured Faun, always
willing and eager, ever desirous to please.&nbsp; There is a
madness of ill luck in all this.&nbsp; Why couldn&rsquo;t the two
dead men have been Charles Davis and Tony the Greek?&nbsp; Or
Bert Rhine and Kid Twist? or Bombini and Andy Fay?&nbsp; Yes, and
in my heart I know I should have felt better had it been Isaac
Chantz and Arthur Deacon, or Nancy and Sundry Buyers, or Shorty
and Larry.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>The steward has just tendered me a respectful bit of
advice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next time we chuck&rsquo;m overboard like Henry, much
better we use old iron.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Getting short of coal?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>He nodded affirmation.&nbsp; We use a great deal of coal in
our cooking, and when the present supply gives out we shall have
to cut through a bulkhead to get at the cargo.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XLIX</h2>
<p>The situation grows tense.&nbsp; There are no more sea-birds,
and the mutineers are starving.&nbsp; Yesterday I talked with
Bert Rhine.&nbsp; To-day I talked with him again, and he will
never forget, I am certain, the little talk we had this
morning.</p>
<p>To begin with, last evening, at five o&rsquo;clock, I heard
his voice issuing from between the slits of the ventilator in the
after-wall of the chart-house.&nbsp; Standing at the corner of
the house, quite out of range, I answered him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Getting hungry?&rdquo; I jeered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let me
tell you what we are going to have for dinner.&nbsp; I have just
been down and seen the preparations.&nbsp; Now, listen: first,
caviare on toast; then, clam bouillon; and creamed lobster; and
tinned lamb chops with French peas&mdash;you know, the peas that
melt in one&rsquo;s mouth; and California asparagus with
mayonnaise; and&mdash;oh, I forgot to mention fried potatoes and
cold pork and beans; and peach pie; and coffee, real
coffee.&nbsp; Doesn&rsquo;t it make you hungry for your East
Side?&nbsp; And, say, think of the free lunch going to waste
right now in a thousand saloons in good old New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had told him the truth.&nbsp; The dinner I described
(principally coming out of tins and bottles, to be sure) was the
dinner we were to eat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut that,&rdquo; he snarled.&nbsp; &ldquo;I want to
talk business with <i>you</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right down to brass tacks,&rdquo; I gibed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Very well, when are you and the rest of your rats going to
turn to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut that,&rdquo; he reiterated.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
got you where 1 want you now.&nbsp; Take it from me, I&rsquo;m
givin&rsquo; it straight.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not tellin&rsquo; you
how, but I&rsquo;ve got you under my thumb.&nbsp; When I come
down on you, you&rsquo;ll crack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hell is full of cocksure rats like you,&rdquo; I
retorted; although I never dreamed how soon he would be writhing
in the particular hell preparing for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forget it,&rdquo; he sneered back.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got you where I want you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m just
tellin&rsquo; you, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;when I tell you
that I&rsquo;m from Missouri.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll have to show
<i>me</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And as I thus talked the thought went through my mind of how I
naturally sought out the phrases of his own vocabulary in order
to make myself intelligible to him.&nbsp; The situation was
bestial, with sixteen of our complement already gone into the
dark; and the terms I employed, perforce, were terms of
bestiality.&nbsp; And I thought, also, of I who was thus
compelled to dismiss the dreams of the utopians, the visions of
the poets, the king-thoughts of the king-thinkers, in a
discussion with this ripened product of the New York City
inferno.&nbsp; To him I must talk in the elemental terms of life
and death, of food and water, of brutality and cruelty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I give you your choice,&rdquo; he went on.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Give in now, an&rsquo; you won&rsquo;t be hurt, none of
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if we don&rsquo;t?&rdquo; I dared airily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be sorry you was ever born.&nbsp; You
ain&rsquo;t a mush-head, you&rsquo;ve got a girl there
that&rsquo;s stuck on you.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s about time you think
of her.&nbsp; You ain&rsquo;t altogether a mutt.&nbsp; You get my
drive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ay, I did get it; and somehow, across my brain flashed a
vision of all I had ever read and heard of the siege of the
Legations at Peking, and of the plans of the white men for their
womenkind in the event of the yellow hordes breaking through the
last lines of defence.&nbsp; Ay, and the old steward got it; for
I saw his black eyes glint murderously in their narrow, tilted
slits.&nbsp; He knew the drift of the gangster&rsquo;s
meaning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You get my drive?&rdquo; the gangster repeated.</p>
<p>And I knew anger.&nbsp; Not ordinary anger, but cold
anger.&nbsp; And I caught a vision of the high place in which we
had sat and ruled down the ages in all lands, on all seas.&nbsp;
I saw my kind, our women with us, in forlorn hopes and lost
endeavours, pent in hill fortresses, rotted in jungle fastnesses,
cut down to the last one on the decks of rocking ships.&nbsp; And
always, our women with us, had we ruled the beasts.&nbsp; We
might die, our women with us; but, living, we had ruled.&nbsp; It
was a royal vision I glimpsed.&nbsp; Ay, and in the purple of it
I grasped the ethic, which was the stuff of the fabric of which
it was builded.&nbsp; It was the sacred trust of the seed, the
bequest of duty handed down from all ancestors.</p>
<p>And I flamed more coldly.&nbsp; It was not red-brute
anger.&nbsp; It was intellectual.&nbsp; It was based on concept
and history; it was the philosophy of action of the strong and
the pride of the strong in their own strength.&nbsp; Now at last
I knew Nietzsche.&nbsp; I knew the rightness of the books, the
relation of high thinking to high-conduct, the transmutation of
midnight thought into action in the high place on the poop of a
coal-carrier in the year nineteen-thirteen, my woman beside me,
my ancestors behind me, my slant-eyed servitors under me, the
beasts beneath me and beneath the heel of me.&nbsp; God!&nbsp; I
felt kingly.&nbsp; I knew at last the meaning of kingship.</p>
<p>My anger was white and cold.&nbsp; This subterranean rat of a
miserable human, crawling through the bowels of the ship to
threaten me and mine!&nbsp; A rat in the shelter of a knot-hole
making a noise as beast-like as any rat ever made!&nbsp; And it
was in this spirit that I answered the gangster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you crawl on your belly, along the open deck, in
the broad light of day, like a yellow cur that has been licked to
obedience, and when you show by your every action that you like
it and are glad to do it, then, and not until then, will I talk
with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereafter, for the next ten minutes, he shouted all the
Billingsgate of his kind at me through the slits in the
ventilator.&nbsp; But I made no reply.&nbsp; I listened, and I
listened coldly, and as I listened I knew why the English had
blown their mutinous Sepoys from the mouths of cannon in India
long years ago.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>And when, this morning, I saw the steward struggling with a
five-gallon carboy of sulphuric acid, I never dreamed the use he
intended for it.</p>
<p>In the meantime I was devising another way to overcome that
deadly ventilator shaft.&nbsp; The scheme was so simple that I
was shamed in that it had not occurred to me at the very
beginning.&nbsp; The slitted opening was small.&nbsp; Two sacks
of flour, in a wooden frame, suspended by ropes from the edge of
the chart-house roof directly above, would effectually cover the
opening and block all revolver fire.</p>
<p>No sooner thought than done.&nbsp; Tom Spink and Louis were on
top the chart-house with me and preparing to lower the flour,
when we heard a voice issuing from the shaft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s in there now?&rdquo; I demanded.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Speak up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m givin&rsquo; you a last chance,&rdquo; Bert
Rhine answered.</p>
<p>And just then, around the corner of the house, stepped the
steward.&nbsp; In his hand he carried a large galvanized pail,
and my casual thought was that he had come to get rain-water from
the barrels.&nbsp; Even as I thought it, he made a sweeping
half-circle with the pail and sloshed its contents into the
ventilator-opening.&nbsp; And even as the liquid flew through the
air I knew it for what it was&mdash;undiluted sulphuric acid, two
gallons of it from the carboy.</p>
<p>The gangster must have received the liquid fire in the face
and eyes.&nbsp; And, in the shock of pain, he must have released
all holds and fallen upon the coal at the bottom of the
shaft.&nbsp; His cries and shrieks of anguish were terrible, and
I was reminded of the starving rats which had squealed up that
same shaft during the first months of the voyage.&nbsp; The thing
was sickening.&nbsp; I prefer that men be killed cleanly and
easily.</p>
<p>The agony of the wretch I did not fully realize until the
steward, his bare fore-arms sprayed by the splash from the
ventilator slats, suddenly felt the bite of the acid through his
tight, whole skin and made a mad rush for the water-barrel at the
corner of the house.&nbsp; And Bert Rhine, the silent man of
soundless laughter, screaming below there on the coal, was
enduring the bite of the acid in his eyes!</p>
<p>We covered the ventilator opening with our flour-device; the
screams from below ceased as the victim was evidently dragged
for&rsquo;ard across the coal by his mates; and yet I confess to
a miserable forenoon.&nbsp; As Carlyle has said: &ldquo;Death is
easy; all men must die&rdquo;; but to receive two gallons of
full-strength sulphuric acid full in the face is a vastly
different and vastly more horrible thing than merely to
die.&nbsp; Fortunately, Margaret was below at the time, and,
after a few minutes, in which I recovered my balance, I bullied
and swore all our hands into keeping the happening from her.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Oh, well, and we have got ours in retaliation.&nbsp; Off and
on, through all of yesterday, after the ventilator tragedy, there
were noises beneath the cabin floor or deck.&nbsp; We heard them
under the dining-table, under the steward&rsquo;s pantry, under
Margaret&rsquo;s stateroom.</p>
<p>This deck is overlaid with wood, but under the wood is iron,
or steel rather, such as of which the whole <i>Elsinore</i> is
builded.</p>
<p>Margaret and I, followed by Louis, Wada, and the steward,
walked about from place to place, wherever the sounds arose of
tappings and of cold-chisels against iron.&nbsp; The tappings
seemed to come from everywhere; but we concluded that the
concentration necessary on any spot to make an opening large
enough for a man&rsquo;s body would inevitably draw our attention
to that spot.&nbsp; And, as Margaret said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they do manage to cut through, they must come up
head-first, and, in such emergence, what chance would they have
against us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I relieved Buckwheat from deck duty, placed him on watch
over the cabin floor, to be relieved by the steward in
Margaret&rsquo;s watches.</p>
<p>In the late afternoon, after prodigious hammerings and
clangings in a score of places, all noises ceased.&nbsp; Neither
in the first and second dog-watches, nor in the first watch of
the night, were the noises resumed.&nbsp; When I took charge of
the poop at midnight Buckwheat relieved the steward in the vigil
over the cabin floor; and as I leaned on the rail at the break of
the poop, while my four hours dragged slowly by, least of all did
I apprehend danger from the cabin&mdash;especially when I
considered the two-gallon pail of raw sulphuric acid ready to
hand for the first head that might arise through an opening in
the floor not yet made.&nbsp; Our rascals for&rsquo;ard might
scale the poop; or cross aloft from mizzenmast to jigger and
descend upon our heads; but how they could invade us through the
floor was beyond me.</p>
<p>But they did invade.&nbsp; A modern ship is a complex
affair.&nbsp; How was I to guess the manner of the invasion?</p>
<p>It was two in the morning, and for an hour I had been puzzling
my head with watching the smoke arise from the after-division of
the for&rsquo;ard-house and with wondering why the mutineers
should have up steam in the donkey-engine at such an ungodly
hour.&nbsp; Not on the whole voyage had the donkey-engine been
used.&nbsp; Four bells had just struck, and I was leaning on the
rail at the break of the poop when I heard a prodigious coughing
and choking from aft.&nbsp; Next, Wada ran across the deck to
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big trouble with Buckwheat,&rdquo; he blurted at
me.&nbsp; &ldquo;You go quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I shoved him my rifle and left him on guard while I raced
around the chart-house.&nbsp; A lighted match, in the hands of
Tom Spink, directed me.&nbsp; Between the booby-hatch and the
wheel, sitting up and rocking back and forth with wringings of
hands and wavings of arms, tears of agony bursting from his eyes,
was Buckwheat.&nbsp; My first thought was that in some stupid way
he had got the acid into his own eyes.&nbsp; But the terrible
fashion in which he coughed and strangled would quickly have
undeceived me, had not Louis, bending over the booby-companion,
uttered a startled exclamation.</p>
<p>I joined him, and one whiff of the air that came up from below
made me catch my breath and gasp.&nbsp; I had inhaled
sulphur.&nbsp; On the instant I forgot the <i>Elsinore</i>, the
mutineers for&rsquo;ard, everything save one thing.</p>
<p>The next I know, I was down the booby-ladder and reeling
dizzily about the big after-room as the sulphur fumes bit my
lungs and strangled me.&nbsp; By the dim light of a sea-lantern I
saw the old steward, on hands and knees, coughing and gasping,
the while he shook awake Yatsuda, the first sail-maker.&nbsp;
Uchino, the second sail-maker, still strangled in his sleep.</p>
<p>It struck me that the air might be better nearer the floor,
and I proved it when I dropped on my hands and knees.&nbsp; I
rolled Uchino out of his blankets with a quick jerk, wrapped the
blankets about my head, face, and mouth, arose to my feet, and
dashed for&rsquo;ard into the hall.&nbsp; After a couple of
collisions with the wood-work I again dropped to the floor and
rearranged the blankets so that, while my mouth remained covered,
I could draw or withdraw, a thickness across my eyes.</p>
<p>The pain of the fumes was bad enough, but the real hardship
was the dizziness I suffered.&nbsp; I blundered into the
steward&rsquo;s pantry, and out of it, missed the cross-hall,
stumbled through the next starboard opening in the long hall, and
found myself bent double by violent collision with the
dining-room table.</p>
<p>But I had my bearings.&nbsp; Feeling my way around the table
and bumping most of the poisoned breath out of me against the
rotund-bellied stove, I emerged in the cross-hall and made my way
to starboard.&nbsp; Here, at the base of the chart-room stairway,
I gained the hall that led aft.&nbsp; By this time my own
situation seemed so serious that, careless of any collision, I
went aft in long leaps.</p>
<p>Margaret&rsquo;s door was open.&nbsp; I plunged into her
room.&nbsp; The moment I drew the blanket-thickness from my eyes
I knew blindness and a modicum of what Bert Rhine must have
suffered.&nbsp; Oh, the intolerable bite of the sulphur in my
lungs, nostrils, eyes, and brain!&nbsp; No light burned in the
room.&nbsp; I could only strangle and stumble for&rsquo;ard to
Margaret&rsquo;s bed, upon which I collapsed.</p>
<p>She was not there.&nbsp; I felt about, and I felt only the
warm hollow her body had left in the under-sheet.&nbsp; Even in
my agony and helplessness the intimacy of that warmth her body
had left was very dear to me.&nbsp; Between the lack of oxygen in
my lungs (due to the blankets), the pain of the sulphur, and the
mortal dizziness in my brain, I felt that I might well cease
there where the linen warmed my hand.</p>
<p>Perhaps I should have ceased, had I not heard a terrible
coughing from along the hall.&nbsp; It was new life to me.&nbsp;
I fell from bed to floor and managed to get upright until I
gained the hall, where again I fell.&nbsp; Thereafter I crawled
on hands and knees to the foot of the stairway.&nbsp; By means of
the newel-post I drew myself upright and listened.&nbsp; Near me
something moved and strangled.&nbsp; I fell upon it and found in
my arms all the softness of Margaret.</p>
<p>How describe that battle up the stairway?&nbsp; It was a
crucifixion of struggle, an age-long nightmare of agony.&nbsp;
Time after time, as my consciousness blurred, the temptation was
upon me to cease all effort and let myself blur down into the
ultimate dark.&nbsp; I fought my way step by step.&nbsp; Margaret
was now quite unconscious, and I lifted her body step by step, or
dragged it several steps at a time, and fell with it, and back
with it, and lost much that had been so hardly gained.&nbsp; And
yet out of it all this I remember: that warm soft body of hers
was the dearest thing in the world&mdash;vastly more dear than
the pleasant land I remotely remembered, than all the books and
all the humans I had ever known, than the deck above, with its
sweet pure air softly blowing under the cool starry sky.</p>
<p>As I look back upon it I am aware of one thing: the thought of
leaving her there and saving myself never crossed my mind.&nbsp;
The one place for me was where she was.</p>
<p>Truly, this which I write seems absurd and purple; yet it was
not absurd during those long minutes on the chart-room
stairway.&nbsp; One must taste death for a few centuries of such
agony ere he can receive sanction for purple passages.</p>
<p>And as I fought my screaming flesh, my reeling brain, and
climbed that upward way, I prayed one prayer: that the
chart-house doors out upon the poop might not be shut.&nbsp; Life
and death lay right there in that one point of the issue.&nbsp;
Was there any creature of my creatures aft with common sense and
anticipation sufficient to make him think to open those
doors?&nbsp; How I yearned for one man, for one proved henchman,
such as Mr. Pike, to be on the poop!&nbsp; As it was, with the
sole exception of Tom Spink and Buckwheat, my men were
Asiatics.</p>
<p>I gained the top of the stairway, but was too far gone to rise
to my feet.&nbsp; Nor could I rise upright on my knees.&nbsp; I
crawled like any four-legged animal&mdash;nay, I wormed my way
like a snake, prone to the deck.&nbsp; It was a matter of several
feet to the doorway.&nbsp; I died a score of times in those
several feet; but ever I endured the agony of resurrection and
dragged Margaret with me.&nbsp; Sometimes the full strength I
could exert did not move her, and I lay with her and coughed and
strangled my way through to another resurrection.</p>
<p>And the door was open.&nbsp; The doors to starboard and to
port were both open; and as the <i>Elsinore</i> rolled a draught
through the chart-house hall my lungs filled with pure, cool
air.&nbsp; As I drew myself across the high threshold and pulled
Margaret after me, from very far away I heard the cries of men
and the reports of rifle and revolver.&nbsp; And, ere I fainted
into the blackness, on my side, staring, my pain gone so beyond
endurance that it had achieved its own an&aelig;sthesia, I
glimpsed, dream-like and distant, the sharply silhouetted
poop-rail, dark forms that cut and thrust and smote, and, beyond,
the mizzen-mast brightly lighted by our illuminators.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Well, the mutineers failed to take the poop.&nbsp; My five
Asiatics and two white men had held the citadel while Margaret
and I lay unconscious side by side.</p>
<p>The whole affair was very simple.&nbsp; Modern maritime
quarantine demands that ships shall not carry vermin that are
themselves plague-carriers.&nbsp; In the donkey-engine section of
the for&rsquo;ard house is a complete fumigating apparatus.&nbsp;
The mutineers had merely to lay and fasten the pipes aft across
the coal, to chisel a hole through the double-deck of steel and
wood under the cabin, and to connect up and begin to pump.&nbsp;
Buckwheat had fallen asleep and been awakened by the strangling
sulphur fumes.&nbsp; We in the high place had been smoked out by
our rascals like so many rats.</p>
<p>It was Wada who had opened one of the doors.&nbsp; The old
steward had opened the other.&nbsp; Together they had attempted
the descent of the stairway and been driven back by the
fumes.&nbsp; Then they had engaged in the struggle to repel the
rush from for&rsquo;ard.</p>
<p>Margaret and I are agreed that sulphur, excessively inhaled,
leaves the lungs sore.&nbsp; Only now, after a lapse of a dozen
hours, can we draw breath in anything that resembles
comfort.&nbsp; But still my lungs were not so sore as to prevent
my telling her what I had learned she meant to me.&nbsp; And yet
she is only a woman&mdash;I tell her so; I tell her that there
are at least seven hundred and fifty millions of two-legged,
long-haired, gentle-voiced, soft-bodied, female humans like her
on the planet, and that she is really swamped by the immensity of
numbers of her sex and kind.&nbsp; But I tell her something
more.&nbsp; I tell her that of all of them she is the only
one.&nbsp; And, better yet, to myself and for myself, I believe
it.&nbsp; I know it.&nbsp; The last least part of me and all of
me proclaims it.</p>
<p>Love <i>is</i> wonderful.&nbsp; It is the everlasting and
miraculous amazement.&nbsp; Oh, trust me, I know the old, hard
scientific method of weighing and calculating and classifying
love.&nbsp; It is a profound foolishness, a cosmic trick and
quip, to the contemplative eye of the philosopher&mdash;yes, and
of the futurist.&nbsp; But when one forsakes such intellectual
flesh-pots and becomes mere human and male human, in short, a
lover, then all he may do, and which is what he cannot help
doing, is to yield to the compulsions of being and throw both his
arms around love and hold it closer to him than is his own heart
close to him.&nbsp; This is the summit of his life, and of
man&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; Higher than this no man may rise.&nbsp;
The philosophers toil and struggle on mole-hill peaks far
below.&nbsp; He who has not loved has not tasted the ultimate
sweet of living.&nbsp; I know.&nbsp; I love Margaret, a
woman.&nbsp; She is desirable.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER L</h2>
<p>In the past twenty-four hours many things have happened.&nbsp;
To begin with, we nearly lost the steward in the second dog-watch
last evening.&nbsp; Through the slits in the ventilator some man
thrust a knife into the sacks of flour and cut them wide open
from top to bottom.&nbsp; In the dark the flour poured to the
deck unobserved.</p>
<p>Of course, the man behind could not see through the screen of
empty sacks, but he took a blind pot-shot at point-blank range
when the steward went by, slip-sloppily dragging the heels of his
slippers.&nbsp; Fortunately it was a miss, but so close a miss
was it that his cheek and neck were burned with powder
grains.</p>
<p>At six bells in the first watch came another surprise.&nbsp;
Tom Spink came to me where I stood guard at the for&rsquo;ard end
of the poop.&nbsp; His voice shook as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the love of God, sir, they&rsquo;ve come,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; I asked sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Them,&rdquo; he chattered.&nbsp; &ldquo;The ones that
come aboard off the Horn, sir, the three drownded sailors.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;re there, aft, sir, the three of &rsquo;em,
standin&rsquo; in a row by the wheel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did they get there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bein&rsquo; warlocks, they flew, sir.&nbsp; You
didn&rsquo;t see &rsquo;m go by you, did you, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I admitted.&nbsp; &ldquo;They never went by
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor Tom Spink groaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there are lines aloft there on which they could
cross over from mizzen to jigger,&rdquo; I added.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Send Wada to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the latter relieved me I went aft.&nbsp; And there in a
row were our three pale-haired storm-waifs with the topaz
eyes.&nbsp; In the light of a bull&rsquo;s-eye, held on them by
Louis, their eyes never seemed more like the eyes of great
cats.&nbsp; And, heavens, they purred!&nbsp; At least, the
inarticulate noises they made sounded more like purring than
anything else.&nbsp; That these sounds meant friendliness was
very evident.&nbsp; Also, they held out their hands, palms
upward, in unmistakable sign of peace.&nbsp; Each in turn doffed
his cap and placed my hand for a moment on his head.&nbsp;
Without doubt this meant their offer of fealty, their acceptance
of me as master.</p>
<p>I nodded my head.&nbsp; There was nothing to be said to men
who purred like cats, while sign-language in the light of the
bull&rsquo;s-eye was rather difficult.&nbsp; Tom Spink groaned
protest when I told Louis to take them below and give them
blankets.</p>
<p>I made the sleep-sign to them, and they nodded gratefully,
hesitated, then pointed to their mouths and rubbed their
stomachs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drowned men do not eat,&rdquo; I laughed to Tom
Spink.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go down and watch them.&nbsp; Feed them up,
Louis, all they want.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a good sign of short
rations for&rsquo;ard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the end of half an hour Tom Spink was back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, did they eat?&rdquo; I challenged him.</p>
<p>But he was unconvinced.&nbsp; The very quantity they had eaten
was a suspicious thing, and, further, he had heard of a kind of
ghost that devoured dead bodies in graveyards.&nbsp; Therefore,
he concluded, mere non-eating was no test for a ghost.</p>
<p>The third event of moment occurred this morning at seven
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; The mutineers called for a truce; and when
Nosey Murphy, the Maltese Cockney, and the inevitable Charles
Davis stood beneath me on the main deck, their faces showed lean
and drawn.&nbsp; Famine had been my great ally.&nbsp; And in
truth, with Margaret beside me in that high place of the break of
the poop, as I looked down on the hungry wretches I felt very
strong.&nbsp; Never had the inequality of numbers fore and aft
been less than now.&nbsp; The three deserters, added to our own
nine, made twelve of us, while the mutineers, after subtracting
Ditman Olansen, Bob and the Faun, totalled only an even
score.&nbsp; And of these Bert Rhine must certainly be in a bad
way, while there were many weaklings, such as Sundry Buyers,
Nancy, Larry, and Lars Jacobsen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you want?&rdquo; I demanded.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t much time to waste.&nbsp; Breakfast is
ready and waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charles Davis started to speak, but I shut him off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have nothing out of you, Davis.&nbsp; At
least not now.&nbsp; Later on, when I&rsquo;m in that court of
law you&rsquo;ve bothered me with for half the voyage,
you&rsquo;ll get your turn at talking.&nbsp; And when that time
comes don&rsquo;t forget that I shall have a few words to
say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again he began, but this time was stopped by Nosey Murphy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, shut your trap, Davis,&rdquo; the gangster snarled,
&ldquo;or I&rsquo;ll shut it for you.&rdquo;&nbsp; He glanced up
to me.&nbsp; &ldquo;We want to go back to work, that&rsquo;s what
we want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which is not the way to ask for it,&rdquo; I
answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; he added hastily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better,&rdquo; I commented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my God, sir, don&rsquo;t let &rsquo;m come
aft.&rdquo;&nbsp; Tom Spink muttered hurriedly in my ear.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;d be the end of all of us.&nbsp; And even if
they didn&rsquo;t get you an&rsquo; the rest, they&rsquo;d heave
me over some dark night.&nbsp; They ain&rsquo;t never goin&rsquo;
to forgive me, sir, for joinin&rsquo; in with the
afterguard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I ignored the interruption and addressed the gangster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing like going to work when you want
to as badly as you seem to.&nbsp; Suppose all hands get sail on
her just to show good intention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d like to eat first, sir,&rdquo; he
objected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see you setting sail, first,&rdquo;
was my reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;And you may as well get it from me
straight that what I like goes, aboard this ship.&rdquo;&mdash;I
almost said &ldquo;hooker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nosey Murphy hesitated and looked to the Maltese Cockney for
counsel.&nbsp; The latter debated, as if gauging the measure of
his weakness while he stared aloft at the work involved.&nbsp;
Finally he nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, sir,&rdquo; the gangster spoke up.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do it . . . but can&rsquo;t something be
cookin&rsquo; in the galley while we&rsquo;re doin&rsquo;
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I shook my head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t have that in mind, and I don&rsquo;t
care to change my mind now.&nbsp; When every sail is stretched
and every yard braced, and all that mess of gear cleared up, food
for a good meal will be served out.&nbsp; You needn&rsquo;t
bother about the spanker nor the mizzen-braces.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll
make your work lighter by that much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In truth, as they climbed aloft they showed how miserably weak
they were.&nbsp; There were some too feeble to go aloft.&nbsp;
Poor Sundry Buyers continually pressed his abdomen as he toiled
around the deck-capstans; and never was Nancy&rsquo;s face quite
so forlorn as when he obeyed the Maltese Cockney&rsquo;s command
and went up to loose the mizzen-skysail.</p>
<p>In passing, I must note one delicious miracle that was worked
before our eyes.&nbsp; They were hoisting the
mizzen-upper-topsail-yard by means of one of the patent
deck-capstans.&nbsp; Although they had reversed the gear so as to
double the purchase, they were having a hard time of it.&nbsp;
Lars Jacobsen was limping on his twice-broken leg, and with him
were Sundry Buyers, Tony the Greek, Bombini, and Mulligan
Jacobs.&nbsp; Nosey Murphy held the turn.</p>
<p>When they stopped from sheer exhaustion Murphy&rsquo;s glance
chanced to fall on Charles Davis, the one man who had not worked
since the outset of the voyage and who was not working now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bear a hand, Davis,&rdquo; the gangster called.</p>
<p>Margaret gurgled low laughter in my ear as she caught the
drift of the episode.</p>
<p>The sea-lawyer looked at the other in amazement ere he
answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After nodding Sundry Buyers over to him to take the turn
Murphy straightened his back and walked close to Davis, then said
very quietly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was all.&nbsp; For a space neither spoke.&nbsp; Davis
seemed to be giving the matter judicial consideration.&nbsp; The
men at the capstan panted, rested, and looked on&mdash;all save
Bombini, who slunk across the deck until he stood at
Murphy&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>Under such circumstances the decision Charles Davis gave was
eminently the right one, although even then he offered a
compromise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hold the turn,&rdquo; he volunteered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll lump around one of them
capstan-bars,&rdquo; Murphy said.</p>
<p>The sea-lawyer made no mistake.&nbsp; He knew in all
absoluteness that he was choosing between life and death, and he
limped over to the capstan and found his place.&nbsp; And as the
work started, and as he toiled around and around the narrow
circle, Margaret and I shamelessly and loudly laughed our
approval.&nbsp; And our own men stole for&rsquo;ard along the
poop to peer down at the spectacle of Charles Davis at work.</p>
<p>All of which must have pleased Nosey Murphy, for, as he
continued to hold the turn and coil down, he kept a critical eye
on Davis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More juice, Davis!&rdquo; he commanded with abrupt
sharpness.</p>
<p>And Davis, with a startle, visibly increased his efforts.</p>
<p>This was too much for our fellows, who, Asiatics and all,
applauded with laughter and hand-clapping.&nbsp; And what could I
do?&nbsp; It was a gala day, and our faithful ones deserved some
little recompense of amusement.&nbsp; So I ignored the breach of
discipline and of poop etiquette by strolling away aft with
Margaret.</p>
<p>At the wheel was one of our storm-waifs.&nbsp; I set the
course due east for Valparaiso, and sent the steward below to
bring up sufficient food for one substantial meal for the
mutineers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When do we get our next grub, sir?&rdquo; Nosey Murphy
asked, as the steward served the supplies down to him from the
poop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At midday,&rdquo; I answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;And as long
as you and your gang are good, you&rsquo;ll get your grub three
times each day.&nbsp; You can choose your own watches any way you
please.&nbsp; But the ship&rsquo;s work must be done, and done
properly.&nbsp; If it isn&rsquo;t, then the grub stops.&nbsp;
That will do.&nbsp; Now go for&rsquo;ard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing more, sir,&rdquo; he said quickly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Bert Rhine is awful bad.&nbsp; He can&rsquo;t see,
sir.&nbsp; It looks like he&rsquo;s going to lose his face.&nbsp;
He can&rsquo;t sleep.&nbsp; He groans all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>It was a busy day.&nbsp; I made a selection of things from the
medicine-chest for the acid-burned gangster; and, finding that
Murphy knew how to manipulate a hypodermic syringe, entrusted him
with one.</p>
<p>Then, too, I practised with the sextant and think I fairly
caught the sun at noon and correctly worked up the
observation.&nbsp; But this is latitude, and is comparatively
easy.&nbsp; Longitude is more difficult.&nbsp; But I am reading
up on it.</p>
<p>All afternoon a gentle northerly fan of air snored the
<i>Elsinore</i> through the water at a five-knot clip, and our
course lay east for land, for the habitations of men, for the law
and order that men institute whenever they organize into
groups.&nbsp; Once in Valparaiso, with police flag flying, our
mutineers will be taken care of by the shore authorities.</p>
<p>Another thing I did was to rearrange our watches aft so as to
split up the three storm-visitors.&nbsp; Margaret took one in her
watch, along with the two sail-makers, Tom Spink, and
Louis.&nbsp; Louis is half white, and all trustworthy, so that,
at all times, on deck or below, he is told off to the task of
never letting the topaz-eyed one out of his sight.</p>
<p>In my watch are the steward, Buckwheat, Wada, and the other
two topaz-eyed ones.&nbsp; And to one of them Wada is told off;
and to the other is assigned the steward.&nbsp; We are not taking
any chances.&nbsp; Always, night and day, on duty or off, these
storm-strangers will have one of our proved men watching
them.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Yes; and I tried the stranger men out last evening.&nbsp; It
was after a council with Margaret.&nbsp; She was sure, and I
agreed with her, that the men for&rsquo;ard are not blindly
yielding to our bringing them in to be prisoners in
Valparaiso.&nbsp; As we tried to forecast it, their plan is to
desert the <i>Elsinore</i> in the boats as soon as we fetch up
with the land.&nbsp; Also, considering some of the bitter lunatic
spirits for&rsquo;ard, there would be a large chance of their
drilling the <i>Elsinore&rsquo;s</i> steel sides and scuttling
her ere they took to the boats.&nbsp; For scuttling a ship is
surely as ancient a practice as mutiny on the high seas.</p>
<p>So it was, at one in the morning, that I tried out our
strangers.&nbsp; Two of them I took for&rsquo;ard with me in the
raid on the small boats.&nbsp; One I left beside Margaret, who
kept charge of the poop.&nbsp; On the other side of him stood the
steward with his big hacking knife.&nbsp; By signs I had made it
clear to him, and to his two comrades who were to accompany me
for&rsquo;ard, that at the first sign of treachery he would be
killed.&nbsp; And not only did the old steward, with signs
emphatic and unmistakable, pledge himself to perform the
execution, but we were all convinced that he was eager for the
task.</p>
<p>With Margaret I also left Buckwheat and Tom Spink.&nbsp; Wada,
the two sail-makers, Louis, and the two topaz-eyed ones
accompanied me.&nbsp; In addition to fighting weapons we were
armed with axes.&nbsp; We crossed the main deck unobserved,
gained the bridge by way of the &rsquo;midship-house, and by way
of the bridge gained the top of the for&rsquo;ard-house.&nbsp;
Here were the first boats we began work on; but, first of all, I
called in the lookout from the forecastle-head.</p>
<p>He was Mulligan Jacobs; and he picked his way back across the
wreck of the bridge where the fore-topgallant-yard still lay, and
came up to me unafraid, as implacable and bitter as ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jacobs,&rdquo; I whispered, &ldquo;you are to stay here
beside me until we finish the job of smashing the boats.&nbsp; Do
you get that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As though it could fright me,&rdquo; he growled all too
loudly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go ahead for all I care.&nbsp; I know your
game.&nbsp; And I know the game of the hell&rsquo;s maggots under
our feet this minute.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis they that&rsquo;d desert
in the boats.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis you that&rsquo;ll smash the boats
an&rsquo; jail &rsquo;m kit an&rsquo; crew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;S-s-s-h,&rdquo; I vainly interpolated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What of it?&rdquo; he went on as loudly as ever.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re sleepin&rsquo; with full bellies.&nbsp; The
only night watch we keep is the lookout.&nbsp; Even Rhine&rsquo;s
asleep.&nbsp; A few jolts of the needle has put a clapper to his
eternal moanin&rsquo;.&nbsp; Go on with your work.&nbsp; Smash
the boats.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis nothin&rsquo; I care.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis well I know my own crooked back is worth more to me
than the necks of the scum of the world below there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you felt that way, why didn&rsquo;t you join
us?&rdquo; I queried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I like you no better than them an&rsquo; not
half so well.&nbsp; They are what you an&rsquo; your fathers have
made &rsquo;em.&nbsp; An&rsquo; who in hell are you an&rsquo;
your fathers?&nbsp; Robbers of the toil of men.&nbsp; I like them
little.&nbsp; I like you and your fathers not at all.&nbsp; Only
I like myself and me crooked back that&rsquo;s a livin&rsquo;
proof there ain&rsquo;t no God and makes Browning a
liar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Join us now,&rdquo; I urged, meeting him in his
mood.&nbsp; &ldquo;It will be easier for your back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To hell with you,&rdquo; was his answer.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Go ahead an&rsquo; smash the boats.&nbsp; You can hang
some of them.&nbsp; But you can&rsquo;t touch me with the
law.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis me that&rsquo;s a crippled creature of
circumstance, too weak to raise a hand against any man&mdash;a
feather blown about by the windy contention of men strong in
their back an&rsquo; brainless in their heads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you please,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I can&rsquo;t help pleasin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he
retorted, &ldquo;bein&rsquo; what I am an&rsquo; so made for the
little flash between the darknesses which men call life.&nbsp;
Now why couldn&rsquo;t I a-ben a butterfly, or a fat pig in a
full trough, or a mere mortal man with a straight back an&rsquo;
women to love me?&nbsp; Go on an&rsquo; smash the boats.&nbsp;
Play hell to the top of your bent.&nbsp; Like me, you&rsquo;ll
end in the darkness.&nbsp; And your darkness&rsquo;ll be&mdash;as
dark as mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A full belly puts the spunk back into you,&rdquo; I
sneered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis on an empty belly that the juice of my
dislike turns to acid.&nbsp; Go on an&rsquo; smash the
boats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whose idea was the sulphur?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not tellin&rsquo; you the man, but I envied
him until it showed failure.&nbsp; An&rsquo; whose idea was
it&mdash;to douse the sulphuric into Rhine&rsquo;s face?&nbsp;
He&rsquo;ll lose that same face, from the way it&rsquo;s
shedding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor will I tell you,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Though
I will tell you that I am glad the idea was not mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; he muttered cryptically,
&ldquo;different customs on different ships, as the cook said
when he went for&rsquo;ard to cast off the spanker
sheet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not until the job was done and I was back on the poop did I
have time to work out the drift of that last figure in its terms
of the sea.&nbsp; Mulligan Jacobs might have been an artist, a
philosophic poet, had he not been born crooked with a crooked
back.</p>
<p>And we smashed the boats.&nbsp; With axes and sledges it was
an easier task than I had imagined.&nbsp; On top of both houses
we left the boats masses of splintered wreckage, the topaz-eyed
ones working most energetically; and we regained the poop without
a shot being fired.&nbsp; The forecastle turned out, of course,
at our noise, but made no attempt to interfere with us.</p>
<p>And right here I register another complaint against the
sea-novelists.&nbsp; A score of men for&rsquo;ard, desperate all,
with desperate deeds behind them, and jail and the gallows facing
them not many days away, should have only begun to fight.&nbsp;
And yet this score of men did nothing while we destroyed their
last chance for escape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where did they get the grub?&rdquo; the steward
asked me afterwards.</p>
<p>This question he has asked me every day since the first day
Mr. Pike began cudgelling his brains over it.&nbsp; I wonder, had
I asked Mulligan Jacobs the question, if he would have told
me?&nbsp; At any rate, in court at Valparaiso that question will
be answered.&nbsp; In the meantime I suppose I shall submit to
having the steward ask me it daily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is murder and mutiny on the high seas,&rdquo; I told
them this morning, when they came aft in a body to complain about
the destruction of the boats and to demand my intentions.</p>
<p>And as I looked down upon the poor wretches from the break of
the poop, standing there in the high place, the vision of my kind
down all its mad, violent, and masterful past was strong upon
me.&nbsp; Already, since our departure from Baltimore, three
other men, masters, had occupied this high place and gone their
way&mdash;the Samurai, Mr. Pike, and Mr. Mellaire.&nbsp; I stood
here, fourth, no seaman, merely a master by the blood of my
ancestors; and the work of the <i>Elsinore</i> in the world went
on.</p>
<p>Bert Rhine, his head and face swathed in bandages, stood there
beneath me, and I felt for him a tingle of respect.&nbsp; He,
too, in a subterranean, ghetto way was master over his
rats.&nbsp; Nosey Murphy and Kid Twist stood shoulder to shoulder
with their stricken gangster leader.&nbsp; It was his will,
because of his terrible injury, to get in to land and doctors as
quickly as possible.&nbsp; He preferred taking his chance in
court against the chance of losing his life, or, perhaps, his
eyesight.</p>
<p>The crew was divided against itself; and Isaac Chantz, the
Jew, his wounded shoulder with a hunch to it, seemed to lead the
revolt against the gangsters.&nbsp; His wound was enough to
convict him in any court, and well he knew it.&nbsp; Beside him,
and at his shoulders, clustered the Maltese Cockney, Andy Fay,
Arthur Deacon, Frank Fitzgibbon, Richard Giller, and John
Hackey.</p>
<p>In another group, still allegiant to the gangsters, were men
such as Shorty, Sorensen, Lars Jacobsen, and Larry.&nbsp; Charles
Davis was prominently in the gangster group.&nbsp; A fourth group
was composed of Sundry Buyers, Nancy, and Tony the Greek.&nbsp;
This group was distinctly neutral.&nbsp; And, finally,
unaffiliated, quite by himself, stood Mulligan
Jacobs&mdash;listening, I fancy, to far echoes of ancient wrongs,
and feeling, I doubt not, the bite of the iron-hot hooks in his
brain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do with us, sir?&rdquo; Isaac
Chantz demanded of me, in defiance to the gangsters, who were
expected to do the talking.</p>
<p>Bert Rhine lurched angrily toward the sound of the Jew&rsquo;s
voice.&nbsp; Chantz&rsquo;s partisans drew closer to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jail you,&rdquo; I answered from above.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And it shall go as hard with all of you as I can make it
hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you will an&rsquo; maybe you won&rsquo;t,&rdquo;
the Jew retorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up, Chantz!&rdquo; Bert Rhine commanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll get yours, you wop,&rdquo; Chantz
snarled, &ldquo;if I have to do it myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am afraid that I am not so successfully the man of action
that I have been priding myself on being; for, so curious and
interested was I in observing the moving drama beneath me that
for the moment I failed to glimpse the tragedy into which it was
culminating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bombini!&rdquo; Bert Rhine said.</p>
<p>His voice was imperative.&nbsp; It was the order of a master
to the dog at heel.&nbsp; Bombini responded.&nbsp; He drew his
knife and started to advance upon the Jew.&nbsp; But a deep
rumbling, animal-like in its <i>sound</i> and menace, arose in
the throats of those about the Jew.</p>
<p>Bombini hesitated and glanced back across his shoulder at the
leader, whose face he could not see for bandages and who he knew
could not see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a good deed&mdash;do it, Bombini,&rdquo;
Charles Davis encouraged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut your face, Davis!&rdquo; came out from Bert
Rhine&rsquo;s bandages.</p>
<p>Kid Twist drew a revolver, shoved the muzzle of it first into
Bombini&rsquo;s side, then covered the men about the Jew.</p>
<p>Really, I felt a momentary twinge of pity for the
Italian.&nbsp; He was caught between the mill-stones,
&ldquo;Bombini, stick that Jew,&rdquo; Bert Rhine commanded.</p>
<p>The Italian advanced a step, and, shoulder to shoulder, on
either side, Kid Twist and Nosey Murphy advanced with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot see him,&rdquo; Bert Rhine went on; &ldquo;but
by God I will see him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so speaking, with one single, virile movement he tore away
the bandages.&nbsp; The toll of pain he must have paid is beyond
measurement.&nbsp; I saw the horror of his face, but the
description of it is beyond the limits of any English I
possess.&nbsp; I was aware that Margaret, at my shoulder, gasped
and shuddered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bombini!&mdash;stick him,&rdquo; the gangster
repeated.&nbsp; &ldquo;And stick any man that raises a yap.&nbsp;
Murphy!&nbsp; See that Bombini does his work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Murphy&rsquo;s knife was out and at the bravo&rsquo;s
back.&nbsp; Kid Twist covered the Jew&rsquo;s group with his
revolver.&nbsp; And the three advanced.</p>
<p>It was at this moment that I suddenly recollected myself and
passed from dream to action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bombini!&rdquo; I said sharply.</p>
<p>He paused and looked up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand where you are,&rdquo; I ordered, &ldquo;till I do
some talking.&mdash;Chantz!&nbsp; Make no mistake.&nbsp; Rhine is
boss for&rsquo;ard.&nbsp; You take his orders . . . until we get
into Valparaiso; then you&rsquo;ll take your chances along with
him in jail.&nbsp; In the meantime, what Rhine says goes.&nbsp;
Get that, and get it straight.&nbsp; I am behind Rhine until the
police come on board.&mdash;Bombini! do whatever Rhine tells
you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll shoot the man who tries to stop
you.&mdash;Deacon!&nbsp; Stand away from Chantz.&nbsp; Go over to
the fife-rail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All hands knew the stream of lead my automatic rifle could
throw, and Arthur Deacon knew it.&nbsp; He hesitated barely a
moment, then obeyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fitzgibbon!&mdash;Giller!&mdash;Hackey!&rdquo; I called
in turn, and was obeyed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fay!&rdquo; I called twice,
ere the response came.</p>
<p>Isaac Chantz stood alone, and Bombini now showed
eagerness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chantz!&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you think it
would be healthier to go over to the fife-rail and be
good?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He debated the matter not many seconds, resheathed his knife,
and complied.</p>
<p>The tang of power!&nbsp; I was minded to let literature get
the better of me and read the rascals a lecture; but thank heaven
I had sufficient proportion and balance to refrain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rhine!&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>He turned his corroded face up to me and blinked in an effort
to see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As long as Chantz takes your orders, leave him
alone.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll need every hand to work the ship
in.&nbsp; As for yourself, send Murphy aft in half an hour and
I&rsquo;ll give him the best the medicine-chest affords.&nbsp;
That is all.&nbsp; Go for&rsquo;ard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they shambled away, beaten and dispirited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that man&mdash;his face&mdash;what happened to
him?&rdquo; Margaret asked of me.</p>
<p>Sad it is to end love with lies.&nbsp; Sadder still is it to
begin love with lies.&nbsp; I had tried to hide this one
happening from Margaret, and I had failed.&nbsp; It could no
longer be hidden save by lying; and so I told her the truth, told
her how and why the gangster had had his face dashed with
sulphuric acid by the old steward who knew white men and their
ways.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>There is little more to write.&nbsp; The mutiny of the
<i>Elsinore</i> is over.&nbsp; The divided crew is ruled by the
gangsters, who are as intent on getting their leader into port as
I am intent on getting all of them into jail.&nbsp; The first lap
of the voyage of the <i>Elsinore</i> draws to a close.&nbsp; Two
days, at most, with our present sailing, will bring us into
Valparaiso.&nbsp; And then, as beginning a new voyage, the

<p>One thing more remains for me to write, and then this strange
log of a strange cruise will be complete.&nbsp; It happened only
last night.&nbsp; I am yet fresh from it, and athrill with it and
with the promise of it.</p>
<p>Margaret and I spent the last hour of the second dog-watch
together at the break of the poop.&nbsp; It was good again to
feel the <i>Elsinore</i> yielding to the wind-pressure on her
canvas, to feel her again slipping and sliding through the water
in an easy sea.</p>
<p>Hidden by the darkness, clasped in each other&rsquo;s arms, we
talked love and love plans.&nbsp; Nor am I shamed to confess that
I was all for immediacy.&nbsp; Once in Valparaiso, I contended,
we would fit out the <i>Elsinore</i> with fresh crew and officers
and send her on her way.&nbsp; As for us, steamers and rapid
travelling would fetch us quickly home.&nbsp; Furthermore,
Valparaiso being a place where such things as licences and
ministers obtained, we would be married ere we caught the fast
steamers for home.</p>
<p>But Margaret was obdurate.&nbsp; The Wests had always stood by
their ships, she urged; had always brought their ships in to the
ports intended or had gone down with their ships in the
effort.&nbsp; The <i>Elsinore</i> had cleared from Baltimore for
Seattle with the Wests in the high place.&nbsp; The
<i>Elsinore</i> would re-equip with officers and men in
Valparaiso, and the <i>Elsinore</i> would arrive in Seattle with
a West still on board.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But think, dear heart,&rdquo; I objected.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The voyage will require months.&nbsp; Remember what Henley
has said: &lsquo;Every kiss we take or give leaves us less of
life to live.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pressed her lips to mine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We kiss,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>But I was stupid.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the weary, weary months,&rdquo; I complained.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You dear silly,&rdquo; she gurgled.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand only that it is many a thousand miles from
Valparaiso to Seattle,&rdquo; I answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; she challenged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a fool,&rdquo; I admitted.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am aware
of only one thing: I want you.&nbsp; I want you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a dear, but you are very, very stupid,&rdquo;
she said, and as she spoke she caught my hand and pressed the
palm of it against her cheek.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you
feel?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hot cheeks&mdash;cheeks most hot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am blushing for what your stupidity compels me to
say,&rdquo; she explained.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have already said
that such things as licences and ministers obtain in Valparaiso .
. . and . . . and, well . . . &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean . . . ?&rdquo; I stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just that,&rdquo; she confirmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The honeymoon shall be on the <i>Elsinore</i> from
Valparaiso all the way to Seattle?&rdquo; I rattled on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The many thousands of miles, the weary, weary
months,&rdquo; she teased in my own intonations, until I stifled
her teasing with my lips.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
