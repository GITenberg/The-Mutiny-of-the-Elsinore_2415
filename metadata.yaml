description: Life has lost its savor for Mr. Pathurst. New York, fame, women, the
  arts, have all become tedious. Searching for excitement, he books passage on a cargo
  vessel sailing from Baltimore to Seattle on a route that travels around the treacherous
  Cape Horn. Pathurst encounters more than he ever expected in rough seas, turbulent
  storms, and a mutinous crew. His epic struggles aboard the sailing ship Elsinore
  have given him a new love for life, but will he survive in time to profit from it?
